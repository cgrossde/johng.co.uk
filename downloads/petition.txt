In recents months there has been building frustration over many issues
concerning the computing for business degree.

1- Unlike other degrees we do not have any easy modules which take our
overall average higher. This is unfair as our effort is not reflected in
our overall degree result. Most major organisations do not care what
degree a graduate has got as long as it is a high 2:1. So why do we have
to work so hard and get a low average?

2- Sandra sends us placement vacancies and then Mr. Doherty will not
authorise the placement unless it has ICT development in it. To top it of
the website which should advertise placements has not been working all
year.

3- The seas has not placed a high emphasis on it students and we have
modules which we are not adequetly prepared for. Data structures and
design?

we are therefore putting a petition together and we want the seas to add a
percentage to our overall mark. Why should we work so hard and then end up
with a poor mark. Please sign the petition that will be going around on
thursday.
