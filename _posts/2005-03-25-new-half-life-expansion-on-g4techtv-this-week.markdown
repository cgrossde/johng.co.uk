I stopped watching The Screen Savers when they sold out and moved to LA but the all new replacement programme called Attack of the Show (wtf?) has a major exclusive this week. Valve will be showing off the new HL2 expansion according to G4TTV's <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/features/51399/Exclusive_New_HalfLife_2_Technology_.html">website</a>. Holy headcrab!
