Well looks like the new F1 season is off to a good start with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4322853.stm">Fisichella winning</a> and Schumacher nowhere in sight, this was probablly down to the weather though and I am sure Schumie will pick up the pace next race. Now that they must keep the same tyres on for the whole race it did seem a bit odd when the cars were pulling into the pits only to be surrounded by mechanics who couldn't do much but stare at the wheels. Sure a few of them were taking temperatures and adjusting pressures but most of them seem redundant now. According to the new rules they can change tyres if its absolutely essential but I can see some teams deciding to go for a tyre change and then later after the FIA's inspection getting told it wasn't necessary. The last thing the fans wan't to see is the results changed after race day. I did have my doubts about how the new qualifying would work out, but with all the on screen graphics and number crunching they seem to be presenting it in a way thats simple to understand. This just means that I will only be watching on Sunday as Saturday doesn't give enough of an indication of the final grid positions for the race.
