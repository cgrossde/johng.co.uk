Rob Corddry is a legend. He turns up at the Michael Jackson trial <a href="http://showme.ahost4free.com/dailyshow.cgi?vid=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comedycentral.com%2Fmp%2Fplay.jhtml%3Freposid%3D%2Fmultimedia%2Ftds%2Fcord%2Fcord_10037.html">trying to get a scoop</a> and at the end of his piece as Jako is walking out of court he shouts at him "If your guilty keep walking!". Corddry could only get one journalist out of the hundreds there to speak to him and guess what, it was a BBC guy, a news organization that he referred to as "bottom feeding". Now we all know the state of the media the US, its tragically bad with almost no investigative reporting - they just leech press releases. This is something Jon Stewart talks about on The Daily Show regularly so it surprised me that he slated a news service thats doing its best to buck the trend. Maybe it was just a passing comment from Corddry that isn't important or maybe they genuinely don't understand how much better the BBC is than any news network in the US. Other than that a very funny skit.
