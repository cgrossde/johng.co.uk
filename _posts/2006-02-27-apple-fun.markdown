Engadget have been having some fun with their <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/27/wwjd-3-results/">photoshop contest</a> in advance of tomorrow's keynote from Lord Jobs. My favourite the iPod <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto">yocto</a>.

Now let us pray at the feet of his holyness Lord Jobs for an Apple tablet.
