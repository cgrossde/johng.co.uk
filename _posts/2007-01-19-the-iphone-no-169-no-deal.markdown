When Steve Jobs proudly proclaimed the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone </a>was widescreen we all assumed he meant real widescreen aka 16:9 aka what you get on all TVs. Finally the ability to watch TV shows in their native aspect ratio without letter-boxing or cropping.

As it turns out after a little <a href="http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9677969-1.html?tag=cnetfd.mt">investigation over at Cnet's Crave</a> the iPhone actually has an aspect ratio of 1.5:1, putting it firmly in proprietary, non-standard family of screens. Why do we have to keep going through this? Its been hard enough controlling content and displays in the move to 16:9, so why can't Apple who are overlords of <em>all</em> the content <em>and all</em> the displays on their platform get it right?

It really pisses me off when these manufacturers flaunt the standards and formats in place by just completely ignoring them and doing their own thing. When you say widescreen you better mean it instead of fobbing us off with this half arsed attempt, hell <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable#Technical_specifications">even Sony can do it</a>. Do you really want to become more notorious than Sony for this sort of thing?

Until we get a proper, true, <em>authentic</em> widescreen iPod with decent battery life and a larger storage capacity this is a non starter. No sale Apple!
