Well the ECW PPV on Sunday night was nothing short of amazing, it 's great to see all these guys back in the ring and both they and the fans had an awesome time.

The thing that surprised me were the shoot promos that were being cut right from the start till the very end of the show. Van Dam has had a lot of time to think about what he was going to say with the injury he sustained and most of it was centered around WWE keeping him down both in the ring and on the mic. After that flogging of the office Heyman came out a little later took it to another level.

To say he was controversial would be a massive understatement. He ripped on the WWE guys in the balcony, specifically JBL and Edge. In one of the best lines of the night and probably of they year in wrestling he says to JBL ¬ìyou were only the WWE champion because Triple H didn 't want to work Tuesdays¬î - very cool. And to Edge, ¬ìtwo words¬ÖMatt! Frickin! Hardy!¬î, that was three words but regardless he is the only person under contract to say that on WWE TV since the Matt\Lita\Edge fiasco.

They did actually have some matches believe it or not but the Mike Awesome match was the best, of course Joey Styles went with the trend of the evening and started shooting on Awesome too.

This was the most entertaining PPV of the year so far, certainly not the best wrestling show but overall it was excellent. It will be interesting to see where they go from here in the coming days and weeks as many people in the company will have gone sour to Van Dam and Heyman if they weren 't already after their comments had been made. The crux of all this will be the buy rate. If it was a low buy rate then nobody will care, if enough people saw what happened on Sunday night and it had an mediocre rating you have got to expect repercussions on those involved, but if the buy rate is massive we could be seeing the revival of the ECW brand.
