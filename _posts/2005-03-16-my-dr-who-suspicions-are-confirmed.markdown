In an <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/03/07/new-dr-who-leaked/">earlier post</a> I commented that the leakage of the new Dr Who episode onto the net was probably done deliberately. This whole thing stank way to fishy and <a href="http://wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,66913,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_3">Wired are now reporting</a> that it could be the work of viral marketers hired by the BBC. Doesn't it make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside when you know the license fee is being put to such good use?
