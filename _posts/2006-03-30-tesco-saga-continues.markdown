Well as expected I didn't get a call back from Tesco this morning about my order. I managed to get through to the store after about 10 minutes of trying but the delivery manager wasn't there so I left a message. Of course I never got called back.

Called a bit later and she finally answered the phone. She gave me some story about a driver being ill last night which she didn't find out about until I started chasing the order! So if I hadn't chased it would I never have seen my money or my order again!!

So she reschedules it for tomorrow, two days after the order was due, but while she's tapping away on her keyboard she mutters "At least I didn't lie to you...". WHAT THE HELL! I expect you to be honest with me! That's not a bonus! It's not a good thing that I should be pleased about, its a normal thing that should always be the case.

She offered me a Â£10 discount which isn't nearly enough for the trouble we have been through. I think she expected me to be impressed by that gesture but I totally wasn't. She should have driven over here herself and filled my fridge, freezer and cuboards with all of my food to make up for all this crap.

I hope for their sake that it comes tomorrow.

**UPDATE: **Order finally arived at 1:30pm (44 hours late)

**UPDATE 2: **Thanks to Matt for pointing out some of you may be seeing Google ads for Tesco even though I am bashing them on this site. I am rather conflicted on whether you should click on them or not ;-).
