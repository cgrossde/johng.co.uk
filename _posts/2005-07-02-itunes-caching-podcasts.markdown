Apple have gone too far now, caching is a big bad no no in RSS and they are <a href="http://dailysonic.com/blog/itunes-49-issues/">actively caching podcasts</a> for redistribution (via <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/07/02#When:3:58:31PM">Scripting News</a>). The more centralised the worse hit the users get if something goes wrong, just look at what happend to Podshow this week. Looks like I am going back to <a href="http://www.dopplerradio.net/">Doppler Radio</a>, it's fast, imports and exports OPML and doesn't get inbetween podcasters and their listeners.
