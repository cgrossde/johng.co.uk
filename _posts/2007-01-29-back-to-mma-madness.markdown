Ultimate Fight Night was fun on Thursday, shame about Herring but he really had nothing in terms of a takedown defence and with that fighting stance he was clearly focusing way too much on his injury. Finish was fun as Rashard Evans obliterated Shawn Salmon with a high kick that will be on many a highlight reel in the future.

So we have finally returned to MMA madness after a few weeks off post UFC 66, just look at the great schedule:
<ul>
	<li>UFC 67 - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A3ox1PhiLE">High kick</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovFomUvbxzI">power bomb</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=anderson+silva&search=Search">muay tai</a>, nuff said</li>
	<li>EliteXC - Shamrock vs Gracie, Gina Carano, CRAZY HORSE</li>
	<li>Pride 33 - Wanderlai Silva, Gomi vs Nick Diaz!</li>
	<li>UFC 68 - Please destroy Sylvia Randy, please!
</ul>

<strong>FUN</strong>
