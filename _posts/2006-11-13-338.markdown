Finally took the plunge and bought an Xbox 360 this week. I was toing and froing about it but it basically came down to the fact that Gears of War is out this week and now I can afford to run the console.

Had a good weekend of play on PGR3 which came bundled and as I'm sure all 360 owners will agree Xbox Live is by far the highlight of the system. It's the simplicity of playing quick games, joining up with your friends and chatting to them through the headset that makes all the difference.

If you want to add me to your friends list my tag is j0hn00 or just send me yours in the comments or by email and we will hook up online. On Friday I will be able to chainsaw you in the face :-).
