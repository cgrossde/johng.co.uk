<p>The tickets are booked, the leave has been granted and now all that remains is to get there and watch it. I am talking about Star Wars Revenge of the Sith of course and this time around I am trying something new. I want to go into that cinema without knowing anything about it. So far I have managed to avoid the onslaught of trailers and promos that seem to be everywhere, whether your flicking through the paper or watching TV it's hard to do, but so far apart from seeing a couple of still images I have been largely clean.</p><p>Why would I do this? People who know me, know I really hate spoilers and when I say hate I really do loathe them. So I figured I would take it to this extreme to see what difference it would make. In the past when I see movies or TV shows I know nothing about or have never heard of my enjoyment of them seems to be so much greater. Add the Star Wars factor in and it's safe to say I am chomping at the bit to see this film now.</p><p>On a related note I see loads of news stories about the infamous people camping outside theatres to buy tickets for the first showing in the US. There doen't seem to be any problem booking online from any UK cinema which makes me wonder why they need to do that.<br /> </p>
