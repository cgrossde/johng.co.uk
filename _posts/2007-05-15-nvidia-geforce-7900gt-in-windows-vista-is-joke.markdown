And usually before getting this message we are greeted to a nice screen of scrambled diagonal lines! Interestingly enough it seems to be only effecting those of who use AMD processors. There are a <a href="http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=26830">ton</a> <a href="http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=25025&amp;st=0&amp;p=153454&amp;">of</a> <a href="http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=24568&amp;hl=7900gt">threads</a> all over the <a href="http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showforum=33">Nvidia forums</a> and various other forums all discussing the exact same problem.

I've had enough of Nvidia. Which is why a brand spanking new ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT just arrived on my doorstep. I look forward to installing it tonight.
