title: "A Good Question To Ask Entry Level Developers"
---
We have been interviewing a fair number of junior/graduate/entry-level developers recently and it can be frustrating when someone with very poor fundamentals sneaks their way into a face to face interview. We came up with a stupidly simple question that we use to filter out these candidates.

> Write a method that can add together (sum) all the elements in an array. Assume all the elements are integers. Use any programming language.

Seriously. I was shocked how many people just can't do this.
