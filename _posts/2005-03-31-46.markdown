I just caught the interview with Doug Lombardi of Valve on 'Attack of the Show' (lazy name). It <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/03/25/new-half-life-expansion-on-g4techtv-this-week/">previously seemed like an expansion was being announced</a> when they said he was comming on but he would not be drawn on a question from Kevin about an add-on staring Alex. Instead it's a new level for steam subscribers which demonstrates some of the new lighting effects Valve are working on. The level is called 'The Lost Codes' and features high dynamic (HDR) lighting which is Valve's answer to the bloom effect seen in many engines (Unreal 2, GTA3, etc). Unlike bloom though this effect populates the whole scene and made a dramatic difference in the clip they played.

He said the feature would be available at points in HL2 and be included in the SDK for mod teams to use, no mention of CS:S but I am guessing it will work there also. Lombardi was adament that only the earlier adopters of high end graphics cards would be able to use the technology.

Good interview considering its length and Lombardi explained everything realy well and Kevin did a good job of trying to get answers to the expansion rumour and the Team Fortress 2 question to which he said "Comming soon".
