If you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend watching [David Chelimsky's talk at RubyConf](http://confreaks.net/videos/434-rubyconf2010-maintaining-balance-while-reducing-duplication).

Using some great examples he shows exactly what DRY *actually* means and shows how sometimes refactoring can go too far. A lot of the topics are addressed in the [Refactoring Ruby book](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Ruby-Jay-Fields/dp/0321603508) and you can search your code for the issues mentioned using [metric fu](http://metric-fu.rubyforge.org/).
