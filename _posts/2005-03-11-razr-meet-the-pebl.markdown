My current mobile is the Motorola V3 RAZR and aesthetically its great, really thin with a great flip action. Apart from the technical issues (which I will save for another time perhaps) its a great phone but it looks like I have just found a replacement - check out this <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/images/pebl_open.mov">cool video</a> of the new <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/motorola/live-from-cebit-motorola-pebl-latch-video-035605.php">Motorola PEBL</a>, man thats smooth!
