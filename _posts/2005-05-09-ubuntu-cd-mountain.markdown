You have got to hand it to <a target="_self" href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a> for shipping these out in such quantity, great quality, so fast and for free. They are just an awesome group of <a href="http://planet.ubuntulinux.org/" target="_self">people</a> who show that linux can be simple and for &quot;human beings&quot; as their slogan goes. The fact I can hand a nice CD to someone to try out makes all the difference in trying to get them on Linux for the first time. <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/" target="_self">Mark Shuttleworth</a> I salute you.</p><p>Get yours <a href="http://shipit.ubuntulinux.org/" target="_self">here</a>, or ask me nicely and I'll give you one of mine.</p>
