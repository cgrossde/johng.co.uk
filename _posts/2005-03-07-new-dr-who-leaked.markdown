Well today the BBC was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4326005.stm">happy to announce</a> today that the first episode of the new Dr Who has been leaked onto the net. Shameless publicity? Innocent slip up? I did notice in the article that they are more than happy to start talking about who is starring in the new series and how great its all going to be rather than dealing with the real issues of more and more TV being consumed via the net. This stinks badly of an intentional leak, but I am never one to turn down such an oppertunity so here's the <a href="http://niteshdw.dyndns.org/download.php?id=840">torrent</a> your looking for.
