Checking out the new content released by Microsoft during GDC this week hamered home that the Xbox dashboard and Live in general is getting rather complicated to navigate. Looking at my games folder it has 92 games in there including Live Arcade, demos and XNA stuff. Getting to what you want can be tricky and it's not always obvious in which area the thing you are after will be located. Added to this many similar functions yield different interface concepts, just compare purchasing and running a Live Arcade game versus an Xbox Original game - completely different and sends my HCI alarm bells ringing.

Of course while I'm thinking of this comes the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN2040725320080221?sp=true">news</a> that MS are looking to double Live's user base and completely redo the way the content is presented. Maybe they should take a page out of Apple's handbook on this one? I do like the new Apple TV interface.

Managing the sheer amount of content is daunting and MS don't exactly have the best track record in UI design. I'll be impressed if they even go ahead and completely refresh what they have now, its gonna take some big balls because the backlash from some parts of the community will be enormous. Good luck!
