I've had some great experiences with Skype over the last few days making me appreciate the service even more. As I mentioned in my last post, I was in a conference call with a few people deciding what to see at the cinema but the fact that <a href="http://www.strobey.co.uk">Tim</a> could call the taxi company with us all listening was awesome.

I also had a long conversation with someone on a landline with zero glitches for nearly an hour. Hopefully the ebay deal will enhance the service more, I would definately consider the SkypeIn option if it had caller id.

Oh and I have added a button to the sidebar which you can click on to call me. No double glazing thanks  ;-).
