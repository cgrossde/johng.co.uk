Been looking into Tablet PCs recently after Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/04/04.html#a9812">pointed out</a> this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/winme/0503/24295/dustin_hubbard_new_tabletpc_experience_revised.asx">cool video</a> on his site. Everywhere I look now I see tablets, on Sky News, <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/04/02#a5015">Adam Curry even has one</a> and my friend <a href="http://www.patelweb.co.uk">Jay</a> keeps sending me snippets from his.

The snippets feature is excellent you just draw a circle around something and it automatically pastes it into an email with the URL of the site it's from (if you copied a web link). Sure its a glorified print screen button but it's simple features like this which will push it into the mainstream.

If I was in the market for a laptop type PC right now there is no way I would buy a normal Windows XP one, there is just no innovation for laptop users on that platform, it's stagnant. A few months ago I would have gone for a Powerbook but now the tablet seems much more attractive with these new expansion packs that MS keep releasing and the constantly dropping prices.
