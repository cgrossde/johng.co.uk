If Dell are genuinely interested in using AMD chips as <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/10/1313245">Slashdot suggests</a> then they will quickly find themselves pushing ahead in the desktop market. I have always been an AMD boy really, not just because of the great price point but because they have always seemed less corporate and more open than Intel. Sure, I wouldn't dream of buying a laptop with an AMD chip inside it, lets face it, Intel have completely cleaned that market up ever since Centrino came into being. But on the desktop I have always bought AMD as have lots of other knowlegable gamers and if Dell can provide a nicely priced AMD system I may yet buy from them.
