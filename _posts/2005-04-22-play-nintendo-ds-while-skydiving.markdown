Another new show popped up this week called <a target="_self" href="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-admin/www.fromtheshadows.tv">From the Shadows</a> and in the first episode they push the limits of the PSP and DS's wireless capabilities. It starts off innocently on street corners but then turns into a full blown game of Mario while skydiving.<br />
