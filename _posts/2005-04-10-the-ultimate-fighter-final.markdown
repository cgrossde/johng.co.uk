If you haven't seen The Ultimate Fighter's final episode (the live event) go find someone with a tape of it or just go download it. Bonnar vs Griffin was a truely amazing fight, neither one of the them would quit and they kept going a break neck pace right up till the final bell. Where the hell Bonnar was pulling spin kicks from in the final round is anyone's guess and Griffin just kept smiling even when he started bleeding everywhere. I am really looking forward to seeing these guys go at it on a future PPV.
