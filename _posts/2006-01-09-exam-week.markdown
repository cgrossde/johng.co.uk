Things will be quiet on the blog front for at least a few days while I knuckle down and hammer out my January exams. It's the final year so there are no room for cock ups, I hope everyone else going through the same thing right now has good luck, I know I need it.

In the mean time do not visit <a href="http://www.wimp.com">wimp.com</a>, you will waste a ton of time. See you after the jump!
