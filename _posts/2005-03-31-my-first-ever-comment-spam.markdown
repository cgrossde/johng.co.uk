Well now I feel like I have done it all. Today I have been comment spammed for the first time ever! I haven't been in the game that long and for some reason I have already been targeted by the losers that distribute this rubbish. This day is right up there with my first email spam and of course my first popup ad, I would like to thank Wordpress, Google and all those other fine web services that make this dream possible. If it happens again I will set up the blog to send every comment to me for approval and stop the beast dead in it's tracks.
