I have been trying to get hold of the new <a href="https://lg3d-livecd.dev.java.net/">Looking Glass LiveCD</a> from Sun over the last few days. Since Slashdot <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/02/201216&tid=189&tid=102&tid=106">posted it</a> there have been no good servers to download from and suprisingly no torrents put up.

For those that don't know this project aims to create a 3D desktop interface with lots of effects like rotating windows and a panoramic desktop, the code has been available for a while but I haven't had the guts to compile it. This live cd will be the perfect way to see how the development is going without damaging my system - if someone mirrors it. If I can get hold of it I will definately mirror it here and provide a torrent.
