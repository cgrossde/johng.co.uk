I am not sure if there are many examples of this but <a href="http://www.tnawrestling.com/">TNA Wrestling</a> our now making all their future episodes of Impact available through Bit Torrent (<a href="http://www.tnawrestling.com/graphics/impact/wk1/TNA_Wrestling_Impact_June24_Impact_Full.zip.torrent">first episode</a>). This is excellent news and furthers the case for Bit Torrent's main stream acceptance of a way of distributing legal content not just illegal.

Of course they would rather have an actual TV deal in the US but for international viewers it's excellent.
