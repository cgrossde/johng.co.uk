I have had the 'Hot Coffee' conversation with pretty much everyone I know over the last few weeks but have yet to blog about it. Part was me not wanting to get into the mindset of the stupid people on both sides of the argument and the other part was I had read and talked so much about it I was pretty burned out by the whole situation. Now that the heat has died down (slightly) <a href="http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/">Kieron Gillen</a> presents the <a href="http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/?p=683">best piece</a> I have read since this story came to light and I agree with much of what he says. I would add that the spin and hyperbole the politicians have concocted from a bit of code that escaped the censor's probe is far more damaging to our culture than anything featured in San Andreas.
