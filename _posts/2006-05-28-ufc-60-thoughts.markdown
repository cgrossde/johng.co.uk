**QUICK RANT AT UFC: **Change the bloody opening sequence with the gladiator and crappy music - it's years old and I'm sick of it. Now your raking in the big bucks you can afford to up the production values slightly, hell, you have done it on the TV shows and people aren't paying $40 to see them. **END OF QUICK RANT AT UFC**.

Man that was one heck of a <a href="http://www.fightopinion.com/2006/05/27/ufc-60-aftermath/">good PPV</a>. Considering this show was built around one single fight my expectations were fairly low but they delivered and then some. Only one fight went to a decision and that got really entertaining at the end as it was a two minute piggy back ride.

Again this month we saw more awesome light weight fights but that division is desperately lacking a title for those guys to aim for. Can't Dana "<a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/downloads/danadickhead.mp3">I'm not a dickhead</a>" White line up some tourney or something? There are at least four guys I can think of off the top of my head who have a legitimate shot and thats more than I can say for the heavyweight or even light-heavyweight divisions.

What did strike me though was the number of casual fans in attendence who seemed to have no clue that Gracie could lose and were booing Hughes like crazy. Well Matt showed them! How on Earth they could discount the man who is on top of the most competetive weight division in MMA today is beyond me. I was very pleased it ended in the first round because going into it I was dreading a potential three round decision victory for Hughes but thankfully he wasn't afraid to go into his guard and take it to the ground against the legend.

All in all an excellent show and a good first outing in at the Staples Center in LA. OMG have you seen the schedule for next month!? Three live UFC events in three weeks! I shit you not.
