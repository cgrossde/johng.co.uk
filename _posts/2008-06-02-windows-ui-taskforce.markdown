It's a huge undertaking but the <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20080531/windows-ui-taskforce-your-help-wanted/">Windows UI Taskforce</a> are trying to detail every single UI bug in Vista. Just looking through the list serves as a reminder to how half arsed and rushed out the OS was.<br /><br />The fact that there are still Windows 3.1 style widgets in Windows Vista is unforgivable, it's the kind of thing that makes it feel cheap and mashed together when using it.<br />
