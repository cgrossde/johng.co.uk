Wow, check it out (from <a href="http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=17043">Meltzer</a>)

> Dana White just confirmed to us this morning that he's gotten verbal agreements to terms from both Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock for a 10/10 fight on a Spike TV special. The show will likely be held at the Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood, FL.

Fair play to Dana and those two for sorting this out. It's a big thank you to all those paying fans who felt they got screwed last time. Do we need the rematch? Definately not on PPV but free TV seems perfect.
