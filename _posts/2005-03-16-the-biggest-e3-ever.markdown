When E3 rolls around in a few months time the whole gaming landscape is going to change. Quite simply this will be the biggest E3 ever as all the major console manufacturers announcing their next generation hardware at this years show. Previously we have had announcements spread out and bits of information trickled out at different shows and conferences but the big three are going to announce and display their new hardware for all to see.

My guess is that Sony will stick to their guns and ensure that the PS3 is very powerful but essentially more of the same. Lets face it, apart from Eye Toy Sony are not innovating, not that bothers them of course because they are making a hell of a lot of money.

As for Microsoft they seem to be on a roll at present, their Xbox is finally profitable thanks to Halo 2 and the Xbox 2/Xenon/360 (delete as appropriate) is coming out at the end of the year. Rumors are that we will see wireless controllers as standard, optional hard drives and more Live integration which can't be a bad thing.

Nintendo are planning a "Revolution" in gaming with their next system which is nice to hear but if its so revolutionary then you have to wonder if 3rd party developers will be marginalized thus not making it a true contender. Also we can expect a new GBA from Ninty as well, is it the GBA2 or a souped up GBA SP remains to be seen but judging from DS sales I would think the latter.

Its way to early to tell right now but I totally see Microsoft stealing Sony's thunder as it looks like they have the right combination of innovation and familiar features that their customers like backed up by a solid online gaming philosophy. And if the plans to release Halo 3 on the same day as the PS3 goes on sale are anything to go by this is going to be far from a one horse race this time around.
