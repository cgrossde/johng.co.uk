Is anyone going to the <a href="http://letskilldave.com/archive/2006/12/07/XNA-Launch-Event-in-England_3A00_-December-13th.aspx">XNA Launch Event</a> at <a href="http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/displayevent.php?id=147">Warwick Uni</a> on Wednesday 13th December (next week)? I'd love to go so if you need a ride let me know.

Peter Molyneux will be there so we can pester him about Fable 2 ;-).
