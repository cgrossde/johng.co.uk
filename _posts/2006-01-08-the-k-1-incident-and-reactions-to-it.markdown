I don't know how many of you have been following the <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/12/31/k-1-video-heath-herring-vs-yoshihiro-nakao/#comments">comments</a> in regards to the K-1 video I <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/12/31/k-1-video-heath-herring-vs-yoshihiro-nakao/">posted</a> earlier in the week but it has sparked a lot of controversy and flaming.

We have had <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/12/31/k-1-video-heath-herring-vs-yoshihiro-nakao/#comment-3608">racial slurs</a>, <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/12/31/k-1-video-heath-herring-vs-yoshihiro-nakao/#comment-3460">homophobia</a>, <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/12/31/k-1-video-heath-herring-vs-yoshihiro-nakao/#comment-3491">accusations of a dive</a> and many other things that are too many to mention. I think a week after this all went down it's about time many of you come back down to planet Earth and realise what actually happend. What Nakao did was merely a taunt in the stare down which went to far, this violated Herring's personal boundries whether he is homophobic or not and he reacted in the manner he felt just.

However it is not Herring's responsibilty to dish out punishment in such a situation, it is the referees and any issues with Nakao's conduct during the stare down should have been brought up with the official if needed.

As for the issue of Nakao taking a dive I feel it is beside the point. The punch was hard and he was not braced for it so there is the possibility of a knockout and sure, he could have made it look worse by lying there longer but thats not the issue. Herring took it too far and acted in a way that would affect¬† the outcome of the fight and as such should have been disqualified.

Lets move on with our lives.
