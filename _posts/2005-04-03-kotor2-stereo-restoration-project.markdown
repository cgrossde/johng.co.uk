Over the past few weeks I have been working with some great people at the <a href="http://forums.obsidianent.com/index.php?showtopic=32817">Obsidian Community Forums</a> on restoring the soundtrack for <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/03/07/finished-knight-of-the-old-republic-2/">Knights of the Old Republic 2</a> to stereo. The music that was distributed with the PC game was extremely low quality and has resulted in a huge uproar in the community over Lucasarts and Obsidian's decision to do this.

In light of this people have taken it upon themselves to attempt a restoration project of this otherwise excellent soundtrack. Markussun over in the forums is the man in charge and has done some great work so far with the very little resources we have available. We have recently released a small sampler of the work he has done which is available to download <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/downloads/kotor2stereosampler.zip">here</a>.

The plan right now is to get the whole soundtrack into stereo (about 160 files) so any feedback you have on this will be greatly appreciated and I will pass it onto Markus.
