Well that didn't take long..

First interview in after graduating and I got hired at the place I really wanted to work! Great stuff but I don't think it has sunk in yet. I am gonna be based in Birmingham which is awesome as I really wanted to stay in the city and walk to work which should be possible flat permitting.

Job doesn't start till next month so I still get my summer break also! I better start flat hunting, ping me a mail or comment if you have anywhere in the city or are looking also.

Wooo!
