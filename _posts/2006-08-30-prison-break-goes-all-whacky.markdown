I have heard many people on the interweb praise <a href="http://www.tv.com/prison-break/otis/episode/841840/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;1">this week's episode</a> of Prison Break but to me it was just darn right wacky.

Following on from a strong season opener last week the show seemed to lose itself all of a sudden and turned into one hilarious moment after another. One thing that was driving me nuts was the way our escaped convicts, America's 8 most wanted men no less, enjoyed making plenty of eye contact with the general public and acting all paranoid. Link stupidly eyeing up women and Eminem Junior overacting like a deer in headlights on crack and crystal meth were just some of the highlights.

Then we had the 'daring' rescue into a court house for Link's son which involved little more than spraying a water pistol black and trying to nab him in an elevator. Surely the actors must have realised how ridiculous this scene was while filming it. Of course the escape was equally ridiculous as Michael and Link sped away in some run down truck while being shot at by Chicago's finest.

I could continue to go on about the Indian-vet-leathal-injection scene but I won't. I accept that with the first season a lot of it had to be taken with a pinch of salt but it was still set in a believable world in which actions had realistic consequences and characters acted naturally. This has been thrown out of the window now. Something tells me the writers didn't think they would get a second season and it shows.
