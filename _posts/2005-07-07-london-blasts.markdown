Blogging this from the office in London. We are on the South bank so we weren't as badly affected by the blasts as those North of river. There are no buses on the street and we have been told to stay put in the office. A few people here just missed getting caught up in it by a matter of minutes around the Liverpool Street station area, scary.

It really sucks, it was going well we had Live8 on Saturday, got the Olympics yesterday, the G8 were meeting today and now those terrorist bastards decide to blow up the tube.
