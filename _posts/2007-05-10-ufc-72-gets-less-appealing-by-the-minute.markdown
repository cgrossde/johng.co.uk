Read <a href="http://www.mad-squabbles.com/2007/05/ufc72-no-longer-on-spike-tv.html">this</a> for a good rag on the UFC 72 card. Now it seems <a href="http://www.fightopinion.com/2007/05/09/thursday-trash-talk-boxing-is-cash-money/">Forrest Griffin may be out too</a> (<strong>UPDATE: </strong>He's back on). This is the kind of card I would forget to watch on TV let alone one I would want to fly to Belfast for. It's also in the busiest month of MMA since last month! Which would make it the busiest month ever and there isn't even a Pride show! Spot the odd one out:

UFC 71 - Jackson vs Liddell
K-1 US - Lesnar's debut, Sakuraba vs Gracie 2, more Carano
WEC VS - Bantam weight battles!
UFC Fight Night - Stout vs Fisher 2 (they had a great match last time)
UFC 72 - Franklin vs Okami
Strikeforce - Shamrock vs Baroni (much delayed pro-wrestling-esque feud)
UFC TUF 5 Finale - The season has been amazing so far and we get to see the coaches go at it

I don't know what Mr White is playing at with UFC 72. It's not worthy of a number, it's not good enough for PPV and if on free TV its going to totally dilute the once special nature of Spike events. Just look at the ratings for TUF right now - over saturation is already happening and your burning the non-hardcore fans out. Ease up Dana.
