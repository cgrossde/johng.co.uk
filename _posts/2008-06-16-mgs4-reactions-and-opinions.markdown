<a href="http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8772271&amp;publicUserId=4551247">Shawn Elliot sums it up nicely</a>.<br /><br />I was literally screaming at my iPod listening to this week's <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3149993">1up Yours podcast</a>. I think I spent half an hour venting to my brother about it and Metal Gear yesterday. I should have recorded it because I am struggling to write it up here.<br /><br />Suffice to say Shane Bettenhausen and Ryan Payton don't get it. They are in a bubble that resides up Kojima's arse.<br /><br />I find it hard to read game reviews these days, not just for the appauling hyperbole Shawn points out, but for the whole meaningless nature of scores and the subsequent arguement that ensues. MGS4 just highlights the immaturity of the entire enthusiast press be it Edge, IGN or whoever.<br /><br />Play the game, critique it, done. Your scales and scores are meaningless.<br /><br />As for MGS4, my opionion can be summed up in one sentence. If I wanted to watch an overly long and overly complex movie I'd go do that, I don't need a game to do that for me.<br />
