Right lets try this again.

I am now sitting in front of a Windows XP box and am back to the same point as yesterday. Clicking on the download Doctor Who button. I need to download the BBC iPlayer downloader thingy apparently. Downloading....installing...done. Ok so it seems to use a download manager that sits in the tray.

Better go back AGAIN and find that download link. How may times have I clicked this fabled download button now? Click...please enter your username and password. Didn't I just do that? Ah this is another username and password which I don't have yet. How could I be so stupid! Registering. Name, password, date of birth, fathers middle name, etc. After about 5 attempts at different usernames it lets the most obscure one through. Ok now I can click on download surely!! Click......boom(!) its been added to the 'delivery' queue. Woo at last.

10 minutes pass. It's still at 0% downloaded. Better leave it overnight this is complicated and tiring work!
