title: "Why Comic Book Publishers Are Failing Customers"
---
Comics are incredibly hard for new readers to get in to. I'm not talking about the convoluted back stories or the decades of conflicting continuity, I'm simply talking about how difficult it is for normal customers to buy books on a regular basis. As an experienced reader and customer of big and small publishers I still find it a chore to get to the good stuff, it's no wonder new readers are being put off. So what's going wrong with [DC](http://www.dccomics.com), [Marvel](http://www.marvel.com), [Image](http://www.imagecomics.com) and the others?

### Finding a Supplier

So you want to read comics regularly? Single issues are released on varying schedules (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, at random, etc) so you will either need to have a shop not to far away or find a good online subscription service. In the UK for most people both are hard to come by, you are very privileged if you live near a good shop and it's even rarer to find a reliable online service which isn't too pricey. Most regular readers "know a guy" who will "sort them out" and provide discounts. Yes it's like drug dealing and yes it's incredibly hard to find these people.

### What to Buy

So by some stroke of luck you can either get to a shop or "know a guy" - what should you be buying? Well you could peruse the bible of comics - [Previews magazine](http://previews.diamondcomics.com/). Get your magnifying glass out and look over all the titles coming out and make a note of the interesting ones. Lets say you enjoy some good old fashioned Marvel superhero team ups, which ones do you choose? There's Avengers, New Avengers, Secret Avengers, Dark Avengers, Mighty Avengers, Young Avengers, erm ok that's just confusing. Don't expect DC to be any better.

These lists are so daunting that only most clued up and hardcore readers stand a chance of getting anything out them. It is just a glorified stock listing. The fact that the publishers produce so many variations and seemingly endless spin offs doesn't help.

### Delays

So you have found a dealer that can send you Secret Dark Avengers on release. When can you expect delivery? The only way you can be sure is to check the next week's shipping list to see if your chosen title is on there. Also don't be surprised if the writer decides to have an extended break in the middle of a story arc or issues just stop coming out for no reason. And don't be surprised if the book is so delayed that it makes no sense in context of other books the publisher puts out.

### The Solution - Digital Comics

Over the years publishers have constructed a massive wall between them and potential customers. The only thing around right now that has the power to bring publishers and customers back together is digital comics. The iPad and to a lesser extent the iPhone have opened up the market to a whole load of new customers who were previously unable or unwilling to jump over all the hurdles to purchase comics. Now we have large, colour, touch screen devices which make reading digital comics a joy. Thousands of comics can be stored on a device. And millions could be a short download away. There is no excuse.

Marvel has come out with an app for iPad and iPhone and signed distribution deals with other apps but so far they are only selling old comics. DC has done *nothing*. Image have to some extent seen their titles released but being creator owned means they need to strike up individual deals with apps.

What we need to see is not just a selection of older titles but a commitment to release digital comics on the same day as their print counterparts. This will expand the audience and actually give people the ability to follow their favourite books with relative ease. So far Marvel and DC are content to sit around and do nothing while their readership dwindles. Forget your old business models and nostalgia for print - it's time to modernise and reconnect with your audience.
