<p><img width="100" vspace="0" hspace="5" height="65" border="0" align="right" title="Xbox360_VRT.jpg" alt="Xbox360_VRT.jpg" src="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/images/Xbox360_VRT.jpg" />By now everyone knows the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4541961.stm" target="_self">details</a> of the Xbox 360 and it is as the leaks expected. The console looks great and won't offend the vast numbers of people that the orginal xbox did, on launch last time many potential buyers simply couldn't get over the size and shape of the console and the controller - both of which have been fixed this time.</p><p>On the subject of the controller it's wireless as standard, can charge up by usb and has a cool X button that takes you to the main xbox dasboard no matter what the console is currently doing. I also like the LEDs they have put in there to show which part of the screen your playing on in split screen games, nice touch.</p><p>The marketing bods as MS have been working overtime on this one as they didn't release all the details last night, instead the backwards compatibility, release, price and the halo/perfect dark issue will be probablly be left till E3 thus doubling their exposure.</p><p>With a solid games line up at E3 they could really come out strong but with the Revolution and PS3 still yet to be shown I will reserve judgement till then.</p><p>One question I want to put on the record before next week. Will Sony inovate with PS3? That's what I want to see next week.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>If your in europe and were going to watch the MTV special tonight don't bother as <a href="http://msxb.wmod.llnwd.net/a274/o2/ourcolony/TheColony_v1_750k.wmv" target="_self">this video</a> is far more informative and much better produced.<br /> </p>
