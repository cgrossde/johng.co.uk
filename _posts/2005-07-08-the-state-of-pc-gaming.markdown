After E3 I was a little down on the future of PC Gaming, it seemed like all the hotlly anticipated titles had been released, there wasn't much coming out and all the attention was on the new consoles. A few months later and just flicking through PC Gamer I can feel confident the PC is still the best platform for the games I want to play. Just look at this list:

<a href="http://www.enemyterritory.com/">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</a> - Doom 3 engine put to good use
<a href="http://www.half-life2.com/">Half Life 2: Aftermath</a> - Gordon continues the fight
<a href="http://www.flashpoint2.com/">Operation Flashpoint 2</a> - Sequel to one of the greatest games ever
<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=59893">Sin Episodes</a> - Episodic gaming the way it was meant to be
<a href="http://spore.ea.com/">Spore</a> - Will Wright is a genius
<a href="http://supcom.gaspowered.com/">Supreme Commander</a> - The spirtual successor to Total Annihilation
<a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/home/home.htm">The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</a> - Outragously good looking RPG

To say that's an impressive line up would be an understatement. Have i missed anything out?
