I have been listening to a great podcast recently called <a href="http://www.slackerastronomy.org/">Slacker Astronomy</a>. They just put out their <a href="http://www.slackerastronomy.org/shows/050314-slackastro.mp3">first official show</a> after doing several test runs and seem to have finalised on a good format. It's a great listen if you want to learn more about astronomy and space in general but are scared of delving into scientific journals and magazines. They make it easy to understand with good analogies and insert some humour in to spice it up. Is it edutainment? Educasting? Edutainmentcasting? I don't know but I like it - more please!
