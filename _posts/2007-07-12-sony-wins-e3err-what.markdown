Yes it's true Sony had a complete turn around from year and pulled out the best press conference of the big three at E3 this week. They provided fresh details on some of their well known titles (Killzone 2, GT5, MGS4) as well as making a few interesting new announcements that might shake things up a bit (UT3 and Haze timed exclusivity, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfICeBtVv8U">Echochrome</a> anyone?).

This left Microsoft a close second due to their focus solely on their 2007 line up. While they do have the best line up of games this year (Bioshock, Mass Effect, Halo 3, PGR4) the press event didn't announce enough new stuff to get people genuinely excited about 2008. They do have Fable 2 and Too Human amongst other things waiting in the wings so it seemed strange to leave them out. The only thing that genuinely surprised me was the Resident Evil 5 trailer. Oh and that guy who came on to tell us about ScreenIt and Madden MUST GO NOW. He reminds me of a too slick used car salesman who has been on way too many marketing courses.

As for Nintendo. Well I hope all those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Mom"><strong>ALPHA MOMS</strong></a> enjoy Wii Fit. I can see as each year goes by Nintendo moving further and further away from what their competitors are doing. Almost makes me wonder if they need to come to E3 any more.
