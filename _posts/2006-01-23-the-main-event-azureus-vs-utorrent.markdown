Yet another <a href="http://www.gambituk.com/2006/01/22/utorrent-great-bittorrent-client/">ringing endorsement</a> for the Bit Torrent client <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/">uTorrent</a>. I have been an avid user of <a href="http://azureus.sf.net">Azureus</a> since the open source client launched many years ago, infact I'm sure that close to 99.9% of the time over these last few years it has been working away in the background so for me you could understand my reluctance to change.

It basically boils down to the familiarity versus small footprint argument. I can see no additional functionality in uTorrent apart from it requiring less system resources to run. Azureus although based on Java is feature rich, open source, has a robust plugin architecture and a strong community around it.
Java is not an issue for me - hell, I have <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> open most of the time because I'm writing bloody Java code. As Java has expanded and gained greater acceptance along with the increase in PC performance I see very few gains in running an unfamiliar, light weight program.
So for now I'll stick to what I know.
