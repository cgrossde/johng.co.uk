Title says it all really. Â£20 to the first person who can find me an AMD Athlon 64 4000 X2 AM2 in stock and for sale in the UK (or available in the UK).

I need this chip - I have been searching for weeks and it's driving me mad.

The winner can expect full payment via paypal.

**UPDATE: COMPETITION CLOSED!**
