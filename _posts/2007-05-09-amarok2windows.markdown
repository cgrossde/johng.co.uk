This one slipped under the radar. Recently the <a href="http://amarok.kde.org">Amarok team</a> had success at porting their awesome KDE based media player <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/blog/archives/374-Amarok2-builds-on-Windows.html">over to Windows</a>. It's far from stable yet but this is a very promising first step that will give many current iTunes users something to look forward to rather than sparsely released, poorly written updates.
