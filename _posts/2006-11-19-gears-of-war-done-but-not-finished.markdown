I have been milking Gears of War all weekend. Got through the entire campaign in several long sittings and enjoyed every second of it (apart from the odd Berserker encounter ;-)). Strangely for me as soon as I was done I jumped right back into it, upped the difficulty and joined a co-op as Dom. The fact that I wanted to play this again straight away unlike anything else should speak for itself.

Oh and by the way if your going to play single player you may as well do so by just starting a new co-op game. This way as you are going through the game other players can jump in and help you out. You retain the saved progress and it might help you in some of the tougher fights.
