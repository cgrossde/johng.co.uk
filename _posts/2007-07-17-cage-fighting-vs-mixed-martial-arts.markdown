There has been a lot of fuss from <a href="http://www.bloodyelbow.com/story/2007/7/16/133359/008">many</a> <a href="http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=20178">writers</a> over a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6289042.stm">recent BBC News article</a> covering the upcoming Cage Wars event in Glasgow. While far more balanced the whole thing is very reminiscent of how many US media outlets reacted when MMA was finding its feet there.

Part of the problem in the UK is that the local promotions, much like the old owners of UFC, advertise it as 'Cage Fighting' rather than 'Mixed Martial Arts'. This definitely has a negative connotation and as a result of using this term the reporters latch on to it and their interviewees react accordingly be they Police or Church reps.

When I tell people I watch Mixed Martial Arts its a completely different reaction than if I told them I watch Cage Fighting. Aside from the fact MMA doesn't necessarily take place in a cage the term also brings with it suggestions of skill rather than a no holds barred brawl. Using the term MMA people mention Karate, Judo, Ju Jitsu, Kick Boxing and more in conversation. If I called it Cage Fighting I'm sure those people would be more concerned about biting and low blows.

So UK promoters do yourselves and the sport a favour and call it what it is - MIXED MARTIAL ARTS. These are highly skilled athletes who train for years to be the best at what they do. Calling them Cage Fighters involved in the sport of Cage Fighting ruins the image completely and opens the sport up to rampant outrage from the masses. UFC 75 can't come soon enough for this country.
