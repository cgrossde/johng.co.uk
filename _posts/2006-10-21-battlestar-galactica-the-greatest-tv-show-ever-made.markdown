I am very under the weather today, and have been shuddering and feeling bunged up all day. But for 43 minutes none of that seemed to matter or bother me in the slightest as Battlestar Galactica was on.

I know I have posted many times about how good it is, but once again this week it proved it's head and shoulders above anything else around <em>today</em>, or, dare I say it - <em>ever</em>.

If you have never seen it, never considered watching it or have just dismissed it in the past I urge you to **seek it out** on <a href="http://battlestargalacticadvd.com/">DVD</a>, <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">TV</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=200852806&amp;s=143441">the internet</a> or <em>whatever </em>and enjoy. You are truly doing a disservice to yourself if you let this one slip by. Seriously this time folks. Just watch it.
