Even with the lackluster internet provided by <a href="http://www.ubroadband.net">Ubroadband</a> here at the flat (yes <a href="http://www.unite-students.com">Unite</a> I am calling you out) I occasionally manage to get a small amount of good old fashioned peer to peer traffic through via bit torrent. As this was happening today I was informed by <a href="http://www.utorrent.com">uTorrent</a> that an update was available and boy was it seemless.

I have been simply running it as a single exe off the desktop for several weeks now and the updater literally replaced and upgrading everything in two seconds flat. Strange...I didn't notice my downloads stop and they added a bucket of new features! So against my better open source tendancies I am sticking with it, bye bye Azureus.
