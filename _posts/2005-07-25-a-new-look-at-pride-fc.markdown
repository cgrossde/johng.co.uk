After the first round of the Pride Middleweight tournament (Total Elimination 2005) I wasn't exactly buzzing about <a href="http://www.pridefc.com/">Pride Fighting Championships</a> as that show was largely made up of long, boring and safe matches which no one took any risks in. After some good reviews of the second round (Critical Countdown 2005) I decided to go back and watch it and overall it was a very enjoyable show. Plenty of knockouts and submissions made it far more exciting to watch than last time and the semi-finals (Final Conflict 2005) should make for some excellent matches. For some reason Pride are calling the semi-finals the finals in all their promotion, maybe it's a Japanese thing?

I also caught Friday's Bushido 8 in light of the recent improvements which featured some great fights and funny moments. The British guy James Thompson looks tough as hell and is just a big wall of muscle with a ton of intensity, finally someone I can root for in Pride. Phil Baroni was playing a total heel and was very funny in the role but ultimately I think he is getting very lucky in his fights right now and is bound to be annihilated soon.

Minowa vs Kimo was made much better by the personalities involved. You could tell Minowa was crazy when in the pre fight interview he said, and I quote, "I will kill him in a moment".

And they tell us there are no deaths in MMA these days.
