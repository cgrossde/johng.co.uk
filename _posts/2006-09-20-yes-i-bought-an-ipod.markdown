Finally caved in this week and bought an iPod, more specifically the brand spanking new 8GB nano you see on the right. Once I finally got over the fact I dont actually want to watch videos or need the extra space there was only one choice. The new 'pods' coming out and my new commute starting just happend to cross paths on the same week :-D.

Much better than the old nano due to its scratch resistance but sadly that doesn't extend to the click wheel which is already showing some damage. From what I have seen of other ipods that goes virtually smooth after heavy use so it may be an inevitable problem.
In my opinion this is THE device for podcasts. I got so used to the way I used to do things (nomad/phone) I had no idea how the iPod handled podcasts. The fact I can listen to something then whack it in the dock and carry on listening in iTunes from where I left off is a godsend.

iTunes 7 has come a long way but it's still handling video like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It's fine for audio but I'm sticking with <a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy</a> for that side of things now.

All in all highly recommended and a good update to the range.
