Those of us who live across the pond kind of rely on the internet to watch UFC in it's original unedited form. This leaves us using either the shady underground world of Bit Torrent or the legal UFC On Demand. <a href="http://video.ufc.com/">UFC On Demand</a> is usually a bad experience as it is but this weekend was a joke. By the time it got to the main event look at what kind of picture I was left with:
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ufc73_3.png" title="UFC73_2"><img src="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ufc73_3.thumbnail.png" alt="UFC73_2" /></a> <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ufc73_1.png" title="UFC73"><img src="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ufc73_1.thumbnail.png" alt="UFC73" /></a></p>
Fantastic quality UFC! This was not the only problem during the show. There was also an issue when they show the camera angles that are directed through the cage. Every time it happens the framerate drops through the floor and you can't see punches, elbows or whatever connecting (a big problem in a Sean Sherk fight). Probably something to do with the encoding of the video and the super low bit rate they use.

Has anyone in Zuffa actually looked at this horrible service? My guess is they just outsourced it on the cheap and forgot about it (like their crappy DVDs). Up the bit rate, fix your lazy encoding issues, support Firefox and don't trip over the cables in the video production van!
