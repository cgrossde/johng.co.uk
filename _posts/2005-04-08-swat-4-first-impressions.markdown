Just started playing <a href="http://www.swat4.com/">Swat 4</a> yesterday, a game that I have been highly anticipating since the demo. First impressions are very good, this is highly polished stuff and you can tell why Irrational delayed it. There is nothing I love more than a game that has been given the time by it's publisher to grow and mature while still in development rather than be made sour by cutting production time (eg <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/03/07/finished-knight-of-the-old-republic-2/">KOTOR2</a>).

Just finished a level where you must rescue some girls who have been kidnapped by a crazed maniac. He house is a disgusting mess and there in one room where a girl is tied up and there are cut out masks dangling from the ceiling and shocking newspaper clippings stuck on the wall. The attention to detail is outstanding hopefully it will continue as I play on.
