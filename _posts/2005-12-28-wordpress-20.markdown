After an hour of tinkering the update to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> 2.0 went as smoothly as ever and so far so good. I like the new WYSIWYG editor, much better than having to use a plugin and the image uploader is nice and handy now. I was also able to lose the <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> plugin I had running before because of the ease of tagging new posts to new categories.

Aside from that readers through the feeds or the website shouldn't notice any change to normal service.
