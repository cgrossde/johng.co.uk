After a mild screw up with UPS yesterday (they wouldn't deliver to the concierge unless I gave them the ok) I finally got the new black Apple MacBook. I've been looking for a laptop for a few months now and being stuck with three PCs isn't exactly useful if you can't take them with you when you travel. The MacBook seemed like an obvious choice for me so I'll break it down. I needed a small portable system (12"/13") that wouldn't be too heavy to lug around and be decent for coding and movie playback.

Having used Windows Vista since January made it very hard to find a system I would actually like to purchase. It's a terrible situation for these PC manufacturers to be in when the software is affecting sales of the hardware. Vista is a dog of an OS and the only reason I use it on my powerful rig is because I paid for it and like playing the latest games.  So my choice was either the <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Laptops_5220890_2-apple">Mac</a> I am typing on now or getting a crippled Vista laptop, clearing it out and installing Ubuntu on it. Wanting a low maintenance system that "just works" meant going for the Mac.

Since I posted the previous entry on the blog a few people were very understanding of my Vista plight and my need to get a different OS while a couple of others couldn't believe I was doing it. There is only one reason and one reason alone I maintain my Window box. Games. If someone could please tell me what the hell else I need it for then I would like to know. I can do everything I need to do be it programming, watching video, email, web, IM, music or whatever on any of the big three platforms. I was never buying a laptop for games, it needed to be portable and therefore not powerful for my gaming needs. Games and laptops are a no no for me, that's what my DS is for.

I am happy running Leopard, it meets my needs. But don't forget if the walls come crashing in and the sky falls I can still install Ubuntu <em>and</em> Windows on this thing. It's one of the biggest no brainier purchases I've made in a while.
