It's been a great week of MMA action and the entire UFC Light-Heavyweight division has been turned on it's head. These are the fights that need to be made coming out of this week:

<strong>Forrest Griffin vs Rampage Jackson</strong>
The interviews alone will make this fight do huge business. The fight itself is guaranteed to be exciting and either man as champion is great for the sport. Make this happen.

<strong>Chuck Liddell vs Shogun Rua</strong>
Both coming off losses gives a chance for either guy to rebuild their career. This one must end in knockout.

<strong>Wanderlei Silva vs Keith Jardine</strong>
As Silva was going to fight Chuck until Dana White jinxed it the day before, Keith Jardine can now step up and take his place. If Silva comes back strong in this one he could make a name for himself with casual UFC fans.

A quick note on the Jinx. I was pleased that Dana hadn't confirmed his intentions to match Liddell and Silva up in December should Chuck beat Jardine. Of course he broke this rule the day before the fight and it was hammered home during the PPV that this was the plan. I knew Chuck was doomed as soon as this started as its happened so many times before. If the matches take place as above and both Liddell and Silva win the fight must happen at that point. Of course the chance of them both winning is very slim.

As for Jardine. He has a strange style, looks weird and can't talk very well. You could apply that to Chuck but he is marketable whereas Jardine is not. The Dean of Mean needs to go down.

Where Houston Alexander fits into this is anyone's guess.
