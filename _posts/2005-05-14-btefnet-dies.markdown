The best site for TV torrents <a target="_self" href="http://www.btefnet.com">BTEfnet</a> has been down for several days now after a completely unfair <a target="_self" href="http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=786">attack from the MPAA</a>. The site is now asking for donations but this is the beginning of the end for this once great community. Their problem? They hit a critical mass that flagged them up on the MPAA watch list like so many other great sites and P2P services in the past. The difference here is that BTEfnet were dealing in TV shows making it even more shocking they were targeted as the MPAA are now willing to stick up for more than just movies.

When these people come in and shutdown these sites more just seem to crop up in rebellion and for the mainstream of Bit Torrent users it's just a matter of waiting before they can get their TV shows again. In the mean time 'seasoned' users can fall back on the more tried and trusted methods that help us out in these times of crisis.
