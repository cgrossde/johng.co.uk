Well it was very close up in Solihull the Lib Dems won by only 279 votes! After being a conservative stronghold for such a long time it's time for a change. Fantastic turnout of 83% although I am sad to say I was in the 17% who didn't but that's due to not being able to get up there and I refuse to support the terrible postal voting system we now have. Labour's majority was smashed so I guess Brown will be stepping up to the plate sooner than we thought.<br />
