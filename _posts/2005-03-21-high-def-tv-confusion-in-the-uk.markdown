BBC News are running a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4361543.stm">story</a> covering the UK's confusion with HDTV. I think the main problem at the moment is the lack of education in the difference between digital and HD. For the last few years its been rammed down our throats by the BBC, Sky and at one point ITV that digital is better than analogue and that we must get set top boxes soon because the analogue transmitions will be turned off this decade. So far this strategy has been successful, Freeview has had huge success as the prices of boxes plummeted and Sky has picked up more subscribers than predicted over the last year. For those broadcasters to turn around and ask us to pay for another box and another TV to experience high def will seem like a slap in the face to some people.

I am all for HD but the only way Sky and the Beeb can prepare us is by letting us all know early what their plans are and when its going to happen. Of course the early adopters (me included) will go out and buy into it straight away but to get the masses to switch over to another broadcast standard for second time is going to be a struggle. I can only see this really start to gain momentum when the first Blu-ray and HD-DVD players and movies are released, DVD players led to increased widescreen TV sales more than widescreen broadcasts themselves did, so it only figures that these HD players will do the same. Then we will have two very good reasons to take the plunge.
