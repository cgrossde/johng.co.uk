I have been waiting for way too long but this week I finally coughed up and bought a digital TV tuner for my PC. Naturally I went for the <a href="http://www.nebula-electronics.com/information/info.asp?Code=0003">Nebula USB device</a> which is by far the best on the market and now at a reduced price. The software is excellent, the PVR functionality is solid and it works pretty well round here even with a crappy little aerial.

Even though I download copious amounts of TV these days you can't beat regular broadcasts for news and live events.
