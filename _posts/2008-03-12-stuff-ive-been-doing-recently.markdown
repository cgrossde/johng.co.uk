<ul>
	<li>Watching the outstanding final season of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0007IK5Z0?tag=johngblog-21">The Wire</a>. More thoughts on this when I have them, but it's up there with the best TV ever.</li>
	<li>Reading the fine works of Chris Ware, most notably <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0224062107?tag=johngblog-21">Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</a>. Creepy, disturbing, brilliant.</li>
	<li>Playing <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000WZ46BM?tag=johngblog-21">Company of Heroes and the Opposing Fronts</a> expansion after they showed up on Steam in a <a href="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=553&amp;cc=GB">gold pack</a>. I have been meaning to go back and start some semblance of an online career, playing the campaign right now to get me ready. I had forgotten how much better this is than most games in the genre.</li>
	<li>Attending what will hopefully be Ken Shamrock's second last fight (let them do the <a href="http://bloodbrothersppv.com/">brother vs brother match</a>). He got <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=9AMcJlr8mbU">knocked out by Buzz Berry</a> in the first round and all I could think sitting there in Wembley Arena was why didn't you shoot Ken? Just shoot and take him down. Guess they didn't have game plans back in the early days of MMA. British guys have <em>horrible</em> wrestling so there is no excuse.</li>
	<li>Catching up on some of the movies I tragically missed recently.</li>
</ul>
