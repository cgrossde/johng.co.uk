There is a very good article in today's Observer about the new US version of The Office. I had written it off as soon as it was announced it was coming to fruition as The Office was a brilliant show that seemed very British and as such would suffer in the move to a US audience. Reading the piece I found myself laughing at some of the quotes from the pilot which airs this Thursday on NBC. The new boss Michael Scott (played by Steve Carrell) is involved in a racial awareness day where they bring up different races and do quirky role-plays, what does Scott say on the lack of Arabs? "I thought that would be too explosive" going on to say they may be added next year "The ball is in their court."

I found this amusing enough to go and check out some of the clips available on the <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/">official web</a> site and the theme continues that they have managed to translate the best qualities of the original but give it an American twist. I was dreading Thursday (well Friday really as that¬ís when I will have the torrent) but now it seems a whole lot more promising.
