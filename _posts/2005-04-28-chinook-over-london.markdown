A [Chinook helicopter][1] just seemed to be randomly flying all over London today. It kept doing large circles from Greenwich to Westminster. It was funny because at one point I heard it go over head then a few seconds later [Andrew Marr][2] came up on the news and you could barely hear him talking due to the roar of this thing.
