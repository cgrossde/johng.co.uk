I've uploaded scans (click the thumbnails below) of the document <a href="http://www.unite-students.co.uk">Unite</a> uses to base it's fines on once people check out of their flats. I got charged for deep cleaning the bathroom (£12) and cleaning the fridge/freezer (£15) the later of which is ridiculous because they sent a whole team of Polish dudes in to clean it during the last week.

More funny though are the other charges. Apparently a crappy chest of drawers is worth £140 and a chair that wouldn't look out of place in a scrap yard is worth £85. There are plenty of amusing ones on there so take a look below.

**IT WOULD BE NICE TO HEAR FROM MY OLD FLATMATES ON THIS ONE. PLEASE COMMENT.**
