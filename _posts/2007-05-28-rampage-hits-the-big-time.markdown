I always knew Rampage could win the big one so it was great to see him finally capture the UFC light heavyweight title over the weekend. Unfortunately the result was spoiled for me before hand which I guess was a testament to the sheer amount of buzz and mainstream publicity surrounding UFC 71. In future it looks like I will need to watch more shows live or at least first thing the next morning providing Zuffa can sort out a worldwide PPV deal sometime soon. On the positive side the odds were way off on this fight so I put my money where my mouth was and made a bit of cash.

Oh and if you didn't catch All Access Rampage last week it's a must see.
