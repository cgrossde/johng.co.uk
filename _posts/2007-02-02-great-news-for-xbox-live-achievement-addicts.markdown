While playing the new Lumines Live add-on packs last night I thought to myself "Why can't I earn achievements on additional content?". A few hours later and thankfully my <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/02/01/540575.aspx">questions were answered over at Gamerscore Blog</a>. Looks like future downloadables will be dishing out achievements as well with 250 extra points for retail games and 50 for live arcade titles. Unfortunately it only applies to games released from now on so no points for completing Lumines VS CPU mode but good news none the less.
