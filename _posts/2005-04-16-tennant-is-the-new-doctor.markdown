As rumoured before <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1461195,00.html">David Tennant is now officially the new Doctor Who</a>, replacing the <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/03/31/eccleston-quits-dr-who/">out going Christopher Eccleston</a> at the end of this season. I haven't seen Tennant in his series Casanova but he was in the excellent <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/04/03/live-tv-drama-on-bbc-four/">Quatermass Experiment</a> on BBC Four a few weeks ago, where he came off convincing and entertaining in his role (although being live always helps ;-)).

I am putting this prediction on the record. The change over from Eccleston to Tennant will happen in the Christmas special.

So now all that's cleared up I hopefully won't have to write about this again until the end of the season.
