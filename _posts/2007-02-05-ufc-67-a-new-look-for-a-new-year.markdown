Finally with the move to HD and at the first PPV of 2007 the <a href="http://www.ufc.com">UFC</a> updated their presentation of the show. At <a href="http://www.fightopinion.com/2007/02/03/ufc-67-all-or-nothing-recap/">UFC 67</a> were treated to new snazzy graphics all round with sound effects thrown in for the fun of it. This is a good move and the investment was sorely needed after years and years of the same stuff on PPV and TV.

Although I didn't watch the show in HD initially I did manage to catch a couple of the fights in High Def the following day. Just check out the crispyness of these caps:
