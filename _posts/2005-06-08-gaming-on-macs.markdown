[InsideMacGames](http://www.insidemacgames.com/features/view.php?ID=355) on Apple's move from PowerPC to x86, "...it's going to narrow the gap between the release of a game on Windows and the release on Mac -- maybe to zero."

Do that and I'll switch tomorrow. Shame that DirectX is going to get in the way.
