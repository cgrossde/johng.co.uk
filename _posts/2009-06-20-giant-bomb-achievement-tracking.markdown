title: Giant Bomb Achievement Tracking

I'm really liking the way <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/">Giant Bomb</a> have <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/news/steam-achievements-added-to-giant-bomb/1421/">integrated</a> game achievements into their site recently. You just import your Xbox Live, Steam or WoW account and they track how your doing using some fun metrics. You get graded on how well you have done on each game and in a big nod to Blizzard each achievement has a rarity associated with it.

The great thing is that this is all based on community data, not what they deem to be hard to achieve, so you get a much better idea of who is a hardcore achievement hunter. It makes me even more proud when I look at <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/profile/johng/achievements/?upid=488921&amp;sid=5172">my Crackdown page</a>. Aside from that it's just nice to have all your achivements under one roof, and they will be adding PS3 trophies eventually...if that's your kind of thing.
