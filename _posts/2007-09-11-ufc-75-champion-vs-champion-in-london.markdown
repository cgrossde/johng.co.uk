I can safely say a very fine weekend was had by all and I am eager to do it all over again when Zuffa comes back in to town. The new O2 arena is fantastic and was a great venue for some awesome fights. Joe Rogan was on a tear the night before on stage for several hours in front of the sold out Arts Theatre. There was a nice bonus on the way out meeting the 'veteran voice of the octagon' Bruce Buffer who seemed to be desperately hunting for a toilet when I asked for a photo. The man is more orange in person than on TV for those interested - must be that Las Vegas sun.

The atmosphere for the fights themselves was excellent. The Bisping reaction was more mixed than it seemed on TV. I had him losing two rounds with the third being pretty close. Rematch coming. The unification title match was hard for many people to keep track of as in some of the rounds it was hard to tell a clear winner. I scored it for Jackson 48-47 live and 49-46 after watching the tape because Rampage did more damage in the third. Oh and if anyone has a link for the fantastic fight montage with the music <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who/_/Baba+O%27Riley">Baba O'Reily by The Who</a> that is shown before the PPV starts please let me know as I can't find it anywhere.

It seems like the next show for Europe will be either back here or in Germany but it can't come soon enough. Thanks everyone for a great weekend!
