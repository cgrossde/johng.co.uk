I watched the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=71140">MSN virtual earth demo</a> over on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> a few days ago and was wondering when google would implement a 'hybrid' map view (satalite images with over layed roads markings) similar to their service. Today seems to be the day and it certainly makes the satalite images much easier to follow. <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ll=51.506178,-0.093212&amp;spn=0.033649,0.081050&amp;t=h&amp;hl=en">Here</a> is a good overview of the main roads in London.

I am still waiting for someone to use the APIs to make it easier to view public transport journeys, it could be done by over laying train lines and bus routes and fetching times from an RSS feed. It's possible and would be incredibly useful.
