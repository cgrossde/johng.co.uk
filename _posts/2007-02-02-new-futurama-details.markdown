There is a <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/01/31/matt-groening-talks-about-futuramas-comeback/">good interview over at TV squad</a> with Matt Groening about what to expect from the new Futurama episodes. I think this going to be great, the fact they are on Cartoon Network and coming back with fresh ideas should lead to the best season yet. We have seen the leeway Adult Swim gets and just hearing they are basing a story on the cancellation leaves me highly pumped for the new season.

Futurama returns with 16 new episodes in 2008.
