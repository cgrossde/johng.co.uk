RIP Eddie Guerrero 1967 - 2005. An in ring performer like no other, one of the greats and one of my personal favourites. It's such a shame after beating his drug problems all those years ago to go out like this. The fans loved him so much they cheered him like mad even when he was trying to go heel recently. And that's how he will be remembered, someone who connected with the fans like no other right till his final days.

Lie, cheat and steal forever.
