As I write this my brother and some friends have just started a TV marathon of 24 season 1. Yes it's true, they will be watching TV for 24 hours from midnight today till midnight tomorrow (just like timing of the show). Fair play to them and I aplaud their effort but I can't see them finishing it in one stint. My money is on 12 hours tops but I'd like them to prove me wrong.

The only shows I watched in long stints were The Sopranos and Babylon 5. Being late to get in on The Sopranos I caught up very quickly by watching one episode after another for hours and hours. This wasn't planned, it was pure addiction driven by my desire to see what was going to happen next. The same went for B5 when I watched it last year, showing just how awesome these shows are.

As for 24 Season 1, lets just say Jack's wife isn't the most intelligent of characters and the stupid messes she gets into are only rivaled by her incompetent daughter. Both of which get a ton of air time in the first year. Nah, they won't do it. They can't do it. Can they?
