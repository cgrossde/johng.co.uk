Following on from my <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/03/11/dhl-suck/">DHL nightmare on Friday</a> I thought having UPS pickup the package would be an improvement. Unfortunately this driver also seemed to be unable to follow the basic instructions given to him when he packed his van in the morning. In my experience all these couriers seem to be completely inept at dealing with any circumstance that is slightly different from what they learned on their two day intensive training course. When I saw the note he had left I just couldn't be bothered, I'll sort it tomorrow.
