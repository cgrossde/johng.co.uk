<strong>UPDATE (2007-05-15): </strong>I believe this issue is now resolved. Make sure you have the latest firmware for the Nano, the latest iTunes and the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936824/">recent update put out by Microsoft</a>.

One of the most frustrating problems I have had since moving to the final version of Windows Vista is getting my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod Nano</a> to sync up to <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>. No matter how you configure it you can't sync up. The only thing I have been able to do is allow iTunes to pick out music for me and sync that, but as soon as it completes you can't change anything because the following error appears (not a Vista screen shot but the same error).

Apple don't officially support iTunes under Vista yet but I know that people have had no problems syncing iPod Minis and regular iPods up to the new OS. This could be an issue that only effects second generation Nanos but I do not know for sure. Has anyone else had this problem or know of a work around?
