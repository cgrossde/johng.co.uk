<strong>Best Show</strong>: Battlestar Galactica
<strong>Runners Up</strong>: The Sopranos, Doctor Who, Rome, Entourage, Heroes

BSG does it again! Capped off by an amazing season finale and recent the spin off Razor made BSG the king of TV for another year. The Sopranos, while controversial, did provide an entertaining end to its long run. Summer 2007 was known as the 'Summer of Entourage' for HBO having the genius idea of putting two seasons back to back and boy was it great. 2007 also included the second half of Heroes season 1 of  and the whole of season 2. That's why it appears in two categories ;-).

<strong>Best Comedy</strong>: Flight of the Conchords
<strong>Runners Up</strong>: South Park, The Office (US), Entourage, Flight of the Conchords, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Screenwipe

I've added this section because I knew I could never bring myself to give a comedy a best show award and the quality has been high enough this year to justify it. Flight of the Conchords came out of nowhere and I instantly loved it, some of the songs they come up with are so memorable and its unlike anything else on right now. Tenacious D they are not! South Park had another excellent year with the Imaginationland Trilogy and the Guitar Hero episode. The Office (US) when it moved to an hour long format for the first few episodes of the season really shined, it's just a shame everyone in the UK refuses to watch it.

<strong>Best New Show</strong>: Flight of the Conchords
<strong>Runners Up</strong>: None

Something is wrong when I can't think of any runners up for this category.

<strong>Most Disappointing</strong>: 24
<strong>Runners Up</strong>: Lost, Heroes

Many felt 24 had already jumped the shark in previous years but this year it literally did. No amount of swerves and guest stars could save them from everyone feeling like they had seen it all before. Lost gets a mention because I have a love hate relationship with it. While season 3 was far better then last year (which received my most disappointing TV award) it still felt convoluted and most things that needed explaining remained unexplained. Heroes gets a special mention for the majority of season 2 which sucked.

<strong>Shows I switched off half way through</strong>: Scrubs, Bionic Woman,  Sarah Connor Chronicles
