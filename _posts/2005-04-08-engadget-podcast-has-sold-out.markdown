[Recently](http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/03/21/engadget-podcast-is-back/) [Eric Rice](http://www.ericrice.com/) [took over](http://podcasts.engadget.com/entry/1234000907038114/) the helm on the [Engadget podcast](http://podcasts.engadget.com/) from [Phil Torrone](http://www.flashenabled.com/). Phil was great because he knew tons about gadgets and was obsessed with subverting the trends of modern law and consumer electronics. There was no DRM to tough and no law to strong to stop Phil from trying to break it. His schemes were always entertaining, his hatred for Wal\*Mart legendary and his antics with lasers and TV be gone in Best Buy will never be forgotten.

So it's a great shame that Engadget have hired the most commercial guy in the whole of the podcasting community to fill the boots of good old Phil. Not only does he sound like he should be presenting on that god awful TV channel [Fox News](http://www.oreilly-sucks.com/), but he has a major sponsorship deal with Warner Brothers on [his other show](http://show.ericrice.com/). Hardly the kind of guy who is going to be pulling fast ones on large corporations or sharing his true feelings about the latest products.

The quality of [Engadget's RSS feed](http://www.engadget.com/common/media/engadget_rss2_button.gif) is superb, they have some great writers on the team and it has always been a pleasure to have them in my aggregator but this latest turn of events leaves much to be desired.

There is some light at the end on the tunnel however as MAKE magazine maybe doing their own podcast as hinted at by Phil in a [recent post](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/03/make_video_test.html) (MAKE:Audio). C'mon Phil we all miss you!
