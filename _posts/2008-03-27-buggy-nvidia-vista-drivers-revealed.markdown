The Vista-capable lawsuit is finally <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080325-vista-capable-lawsuit-paints-picture-of-buggy-nvidia-drivers.html">yielding some facts</a> about Nvidia's record of horrendous driver support for Microsoft's latest OS. This is of particular interest to me as last year I <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2007/05/17/amd-ati-radeon-hd-2900-xt-notes/">switched over to ATI</a> after many months of <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2007/05/15/nvidia-geforce-7900gt-in-windows-vista-is-joke/">problems with my Nvidia card under Vista</a> (which worked flawlessly in XP). This caused me a lot of wasted time and my wallet was significantly lighter by the end of it. According to the newly released documents they were responsible for 479,000 crashes making up 29% of the total logged! 17.9% are Microsoft's fault, those are the crashes that made me <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2008/01/12/bye-bye-vista/">switch back to XP</a> even after shelling out for the OS and new hardware for it.
