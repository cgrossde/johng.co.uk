Since the upgrade to Wordpress 2.5 this site seems ok from where you are looking but is rather messed up behind the scenes. It has been <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/165449">widely documented</a> on the Wordpress forums that there is an issue with TinyMCE and the WYSIWYG interface. I have the issue and like many people with the same problem cannot resolve it using any of the methods described to me. XML-RPC in <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">Mars Edit</a> also seems to be broken. The only thing that seems to work is <a href="http://www.scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a> in Firefox. I'll be using it until Wordpress is fixed. Let me know if there are any problems.<br />
