title: "Buying An iMac: The Waiting Game"
---
I almost bought the new 27" iMac when they were announced in October last year. Finally Apple had released the computer I was waiting for and addressed all the key issues that had prevented me from purchasing an iMac before, namely

*	Quad core modern CPU
*	Video input from an external source
*	LED backlighting
*	Larger screen

I even went so far as to ordering the super high end Core i7 version but wound up cancelling due to my finances that month. Since then I've been so busy with work and other projects that I never got round to ordering again.

###	Boom Goes the PC

A few nights ago my main PC that I use for gaming (and as a backup when we need more than one computer) stopped working. I had a poke around but couldn't see anything wrong. I just don't have parts anymore to go through replacing each component to find the problem.

Now my time is freeing up slightly and I'm ready to play a [few more](http://www.dawnofwar2.com/us/chaos-rising/campaign) [PC games](http://dragonage.bioware.com/awakening/) and I have no computer to play them on. 

### The Waiting Game

So I need to get an iMac but its got to that point where I've waited too long. It's a uniquely Apple problem that I can't justify the purchase even though the system has only been on the market for 4 months. The best time to buy their products is as soon as they come out so they retain value and you ensure you always have the latest model.

I'm fully aware that the previous update was a major overhaul and as such the next update will be relatively minor but I still think it's worth waiting a couple of months if they are going to bump up the CPU or graphics card.

[MacRumor's buyers guide](http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac) suggests updates usually happen every 221 days. That means updates could happen around the 29th May. It's awful having to wait that long but that's the price you pay for a good computer.
