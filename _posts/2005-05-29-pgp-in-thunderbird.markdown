Ok firstly that <a target="_self" href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/mozmail-5-23-log.html">chat log</a> was dated back from 2001 before Thunderbird even existed and secondly there is an excellent extension with full GnuPG/OpenPGP support available called <a target="_self" href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/">Enigmail</a> (since 3/15/2001). Get off your high horse and search on Google before bashing outstanding open source projects like this. Please, I encourage you to use Outlook Express and enjoy the pleasures of a bug ridden, virus laden and highly exploitable pile of crap.<br />
