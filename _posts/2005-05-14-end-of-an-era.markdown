I was 8 when I saw my first Star Trek movie at the cinema, it was the sixth movie, not great in hindsight but I loved it at the time and have grown up on Star Trek ever since. I just finished watching the final episode of Enterprise and what will probably be the last new Star Trek content produced for a number of years.

And I miss it already. It's ironic that the best writing, acting and overall engaging storylines took place in the show's final season. Maybe they were feeling the heat of cancellation or maybe they felt they had nothing to lose, but this year has easily been the best for Trek since Deep Space 9 at it's peak, if only they had started the series this way it may have survived beyond four years. At least it went out pleasing the fans (see picture) and with it's head held high.

I look forward to what the future might bring (rumoured movie trilogy anyone?) but for now they can safely hand the baton on to the awesome Battlestar Galactica to carry us through this trekless period. Live long and prosper.
