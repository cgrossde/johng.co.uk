It's the first big PC release in a while tomorrow when Brother's in Arms is released in the UK. Many games were inspired by Band of Brothers and this is no exception, it follows the lives of the 101st Airbourne divison during the D-Day landings more closely than Medal of Honour or Call of Duty ever did. Looks very promising and hopefully the cross platform development won't hurt it too badly. I will give it a good play through the weekend and let you know what its like.
