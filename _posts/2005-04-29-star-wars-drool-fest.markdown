<p>The new live action Star Wars TV show has been <a href="http://comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=9301" target="_self">confirmed</a> by George Lucas at last. It will be set&nbsp;between episodes 3 and 4 as expected and will not feature any of the main cast.</p><p><img width="102" vspace="0" hspace="5" height="200" border="0" align="right" title="boba-fett.jpg" alt="boba-fett.jpg" src="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/images/boba-fett.jpg" />I am hugely&nbsp;looking forward to this. The fact that we will have a weekly Star Wars TV show is just incredible, I can't believe I am typing it. The scope and the depth of this thing could be massive and I just hope we get something more along the lines of Babylon 5 or Battlestar Galactica than a bad Star Trek (Voyager 1 Season 1 -&nbsp;Enterprise Season 2). Writing will be the key here, they need to hire the guys who do these great scifi shows and not rely on Lucas and his buddies to write it.</p><p>One of the cool ideas I heard a few months back for the show was&nbsp;a story&nbsp;that follows Bobba Fett arround the galaxy. That would make for an action packed show but his acting range is very limited with&nbsp;a helmet on ;-).</p>
