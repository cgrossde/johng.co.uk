Along with the massive <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html">Intel announcement</a> that you can read about anywhere Apple quietly released <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">Quicktime 7 preview for Windows</a> yesterday opening the world of H.264 high def goodness to everyone. I laughed when I first saw the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/recommendations.html">system requirements</a>, dual 2.8GHz Zeons for 720p, they must be kidding right? Unfortunately not. After trying the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/batmanbegins.html">Batman Begins trailer</a> it's clear you need a beast of a system to get good frame rate. My Athlon XP 3200 handles MPEG2 HD content nicely but I will need to upgrade to get the full H.264 experience.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new benchmark!
