<p>Haven't blogged for a few days, been back home and didn't find the time. Saw Star Wars Thursday night and man it was good. It was rammed in Star City, something that doesn't happen to often given the size of the place, so it was a good job I had tickets booked and we were there early. Personally I thought the film was awesome, a non stop romp through the Star Wars universe with a power and presence that the other prequels lacked. Many critics have slated the poor pacing and generally bad directing in the movie but when I was in there I didn't notice it one bit. The sheer epic scale of what was happening and the fact my presumptions and predictions about what happened between episodes two and four were finally materialising on the screen made it intensely exciting. Seeing Anakin's fall and the way he is transformed into Vader was something I had waited so long to see that perhaps I enjoyed it on a different level to what the critics were describing.</p><p>Anyway, back to Lego Star Wars :-)<br /> </p>
