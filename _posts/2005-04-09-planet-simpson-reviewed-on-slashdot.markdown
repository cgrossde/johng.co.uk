Wow Slashdot have actually <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/08/1849245&from=rss">reviewed</a> a book I am currently reading called <a href="http://www.planetsimpson.com/">Planet Simpson by Chris Turner</a>. I am up to the chapter on Marge and so far it has been a funny and interesting read.
