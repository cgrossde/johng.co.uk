I would give my thoughts on the new Nintendo <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3143782">Revolution controller revealed</a> at TGS but right now there isn't much to say. Sure it's different and its unique features hold a lot of promise, but sadly no games have been announced for the system yet so passing judgement is rather difficult.

It's great to see some innovation in the next generation, lets just hope it lives up to the massive potential this controller serves up.
