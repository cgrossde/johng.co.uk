I was discussing the potential of the Star Wars live action TV show the other day and wondered where George Lucas would be drawing his inspiration for how it should be structured and presented. I'd hoped Battlestar obviously but was pleasantly surprised to see <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/03/18/george-lucas-talks-live-action-star-wars-tv-series/">this on Slashfilm this morning</a>,

> Some of the characters from the features find their way in there, so it's not completely divorced. It's as if we just went down the street and told a different story. You know, we were doing, I don't know, 24, and now we're going to move down the street here and do The Wire. Same thing, it's different people doing the same thing in the same city.

Yes he said THE WIRE, everybody's favourite Baltimore based drug busting masterpiece. My expectations have significantly increased in the hopes they can pull off a character driven tightly nit story. I'm just glad he is aware of some of the best contemporary TV out there, we don't need another Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.
