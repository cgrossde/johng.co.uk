Not only does Ron Moore come out with the best new TV show this year with <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a> but he also gives the fans what they want. First an <a href="http://blog.scifi.com/battlestar/">insider blog</a> where he answers the fans questions indepth but now also a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/">podcast</a>! Holy cow he is on the ball. It's like an audio commentary but you don't have to wait for the DVDs to come out.

Berman take note.
