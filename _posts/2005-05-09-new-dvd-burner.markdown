They are seriously cheap right now, I managed to pickup the <a target="_self" href="http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=83439">LG GSA4163B</a> for only &pound;42.29 and that's one of the best drives out there. It's taken me so long to order one because I have been lucky enough to live with people who have burners already whether it's my Dad's or a housemate's. My current Xbox problems (I need to burn repair DVDs) only sealed the deal, it's just a great shame that the dual layer media is so expensive as I have stuff that is larger than 4GB to burn.<br />
