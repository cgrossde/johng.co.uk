Just a quick heads up to say that Forrest Griffin, Tyson Griffin, Martin Kampmann and Jay Hieron will all be in Belfast Wednesday night 7pm at the Odyssey Sports Complex in Belfast. You'll be able to meet these members of Xtreme Couture, get autographs signed and have a better idea of who you should be betting on come UFC 72 on Saturday...ahem.
