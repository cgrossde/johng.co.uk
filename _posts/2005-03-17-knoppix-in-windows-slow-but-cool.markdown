I had time to try out the latest Knoppix release from CeBIT this morning which <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/16/0210216&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=1">slashdot reported on yesterday</a>. I am very impressed with the Qemu feature in Windows, you just stick the CD into any XP system and the boot prompt pops up in an emulated terminal. You get all the features of normal Knoppix but without the hassle of rebooting. Although it did run slow and take a while to boot on the laptop I tested it on (Dell D400) I believe this is one great way the OSS community can look at promoting Linux to Windows users. Hopefully with future versions we will see a faster performance but for now its a great demo of things to come.
