I've been looking forward to a new Audioslave album for ages, so it was great to listen to the first single from it called Be Yourself. Very catchy and keeps with the style of the previous album, us Rageoholics will have to wait a little longer for the heavier stuff I feel. Found out they are playing three nights in Brixton at the end of June so I will try to get up there and catch them live, just try and stop my chanting "Killing in the Name" ;-).

You can take Morello out of the Whammy but you can't take the Whammy out of Morello.
