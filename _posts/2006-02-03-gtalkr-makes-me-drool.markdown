Ok if you think AJAX is just another web development fad check out whats going on over at <a href="https://gtalkr.com/">Gtalkr</a>.

Just sign in with your Google ID and they bring a ton of services together in one easy to use AJAX desktop. From just glancing at the front page I can see Gmail, Google Talk, Flickr and You Tube. By the way You Tube takes Google Video and sticks it where the sun doesn't shine and that's why it's featured here.

Hopefully they will add more services soon but right now it's already highly useable and very useful.
