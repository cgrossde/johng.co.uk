Overnight it would seem that the popular web based news aggregator <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a> has added new features to it's service that make it frustrating and unwieldy to use.

Many people such as myself consume a large proportion of our daily news through the service. There is a lot of junk out there whether it be redundant news items or just simply things that don't interest me. NewsGator used to display the entire contents of a feed, allowing hundreds of articles and posts to be quickly scanned through and stopped at if they peaked my interest.

To hamper this, in a clear effort to save bandwidth, they have restricted the length of all items to 3 lines and added a <img id="image362" alt="Plus" src="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/plus_icon.gif" /> icon next to each entry which allows it to be expanded to show the full content. Right now I have 412 unread items in NewsGator and I do not plan on clicking on that little icon 412 times.

The great thing about NewsGator was it treated feeds like a river and not the email style system so many of their competitors were using. This is a massive step back and judging by a quick <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/newsgator">Technorati search</a> I am <a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/journal/390/newsgator-online-rolls-out-minor-changes">not </a><a href="http://www.openthedialogue.com/2006/12/newsgator_makes_changes_includ_1.html">the</a><a href="http://www.openthedialogue.com/2006/12/newsgator_makes_changes_includ_1.html"> only one annoyed</a> by this.

For a temporary solution to this I recommend logging into the <a href="http://www.newsgator.co.uk/">UK version of NewsGator</a> which is held back a few versions from the main site. But when the update hits there you can guarantee I will be switching to something else. Any recommendations?
