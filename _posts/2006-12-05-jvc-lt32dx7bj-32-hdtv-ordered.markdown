We popped into John Lewis over the weekend hoping to pick up a new TV (<a href="http://www.jvc.co.uk/product.php?id=LT-32DX7BJ&catid=100088">JVC LT32DX7BJ</a>) only to be told it wouldn't be available till Friday. Why must I wait for my HD goodness!

Seems like a good display and if you go into the store its <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/Audio+and+TV/Televisions/Televisions/LCD+TV/1284/230335159/Product.aspx">¬£200 less than on the website</a> even though it's probably going to be delivered from the same warehouse. It will be nice to finally get a new TV, we completely skipped getting a regular wide-screen so we are about due.

It's only recently that they became viable with the reduction in LCD prices and more HD content being available either via Sky HD or the Xbox 360. Not that we are subscribing to Sky HD yet - that's a whole other investment.

I'll have some time to play with it over the weekend so I'll post my thoughts up when I get the chance. Gears on insane difficulty in HD sounds good to me!
