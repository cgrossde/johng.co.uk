Ok I am warning you now this one is for people who have too much time on their hands and are extremely sad.

If you have ever watched the unique internet TV show <a href="http://www.welcometothescene.com">The Scene</a> and found it a little unrealistic then you need <a href="http://www.welcometotehscene.com">Teh Scene</a>. A hilarious parody of the original, Teh Scene is produced under distinctly low budget and features the antics of the scene group XPC in their bid to be 1337 and all that other scener stuff. It's deliberately crappy but there are genuinely funny moments to be found throughout such as XPC's high standards dictate that all movies must be released in VCD on at least 10 CDs.

Amazingly they even have some of their stuff listed up at <a href="http://www.vcdquality.com">VCD Quality</a> and it hasn't been nuked. If you heed the warning at the top of this post then you just might enjoy this homemade TV show.
