Although still in an early stage of development the <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a> project looks like it has a load of potential. It's essentially an open source alternative to iTunes built on the same platform as Mozilla Firefox. I am one of the biggest critics of iTunes but also one of it's biggest users so the idea of this really appeals to me. If they can nail streaming, podcasting and stability (something iTunes sorely lacks) then we could be in for a winner.

Of course being open source and extension friendly means the sooner they get this app out into the world the sooner we can all start tweaking and making it better. Even if podcast support isn't there initially it can be bolted on with minimal effort for the average Mozilla developer. This bird might just fly.
