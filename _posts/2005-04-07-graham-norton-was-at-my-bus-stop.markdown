I was waiting for the bus on my way home from work today and who should I see but Graham Norton. He came out of King's Reach Tower on Stamford Street, walked over to the bus stop and chucked something in the bin near to where I was standing then proceeded on towards Blackfriars Bridge. He didn't seem to be in much of a hurry to be anywhere and had a smirk on his face. You certainly see far more celebrities when you live in London.
