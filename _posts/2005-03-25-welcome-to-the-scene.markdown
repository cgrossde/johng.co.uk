Just started watching an internet TV show called <a href="http://www.welcometothescene.com/">The Scene</a>. It's very unique to say the least, it's about a scene group who release movies onto the internet before anyone else and you can't help but think the people involved in the project have come from such a background themselves. Presented as though you were looking at the character's computer screen, most of the story is told by reading the IRC and IM chatting that is going on between the members of this release group. You also get to see the person in question in a kind of webcam view in the top left of the screen. It's certainly very different and not everyone's taste but will entertain those interested in learning more about the under ground world of the scene.
