[![](http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/160x120_itv_hd.jpg)](http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/160x120_itv_hd.jpg)As much as I hate Sky, I hate ITV even more. And today is no exception with the announcement that <a href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a95404/sky-attacks-itv-over-hd-exclusivity.html">ITV HD will be a Freesat exclusive</a>. So rather than rolling out their channel to the largest established HD platform in the UK (Sky HD) they choose to go with the unproven service that just launched.

There is no technical need for it to be exclusive to Freesat. It all comes from the same satelite orbiting the Earth regardless of which service you sign up for. BBC HD which is available on both proves this. As far as I can see the only thing they need to do is maintain two EPG formats - thats it.

We all know how well it went the last time ITV were a platform holder (hint: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itv_digital#Failure">horribly</a>) and it looks like they are well on their way to screwing things up again.

Not that I watch anything on ITV.
