title: Dipping into Python

Had the urge to start trying out Python this week what with the lack of full time job and all. I was trying to do some HTML parsing and RSS generation in Java and it was proving way too bloated and taking way too long to get where I wanted it to be. What was taking me several days in a language I use regularly and am paid to develop in took mere hours in Python which I hadn't ever touched.

I think this just proves that there really isn't one language that works well at everything and anyone who claims so is mad. Where Python really excels is in text and file processing something at which Java, among all it's many different stream readers and writers, over complicates things.

I am definately going to start using it more for file processing and general 'application glue' and maybe look into the web services wing of it (<a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a> and <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a>) as it seems a great alternative to traditional PHP also.
