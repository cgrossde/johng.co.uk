After a very productive weekend of getting a large chunk of C++ reading and research done it's clear that I am so much more productive at home than in the office. Right now I have a throbbing headache from the phones all around me that won't stop ringing and the constant background chatter that I am starting to notice more and more. At first it would seem there are more distractions at home, whether it's the fast net connection, TV, games, guitars or making an elaborate lunch but these things actually add up to less than the office. When I do let go and do one of these activities, afterwards I feel more relaxed and more motivated to work as a result <p>It's debatable if I could do my current job from home, but being the general student dogsbody I am here that could never happen. Of course if I were doing the job I should be this year, programming, that would be more of a possibility as it's the kind of thing that you need to lock yourself away to do. Instead I have to fill my weekends with that activity if I am to stand a chance of getting off to a good start at uni in October.</p> <p>**UPDATE**: I also sit next to a big fat printer that won't stop printing. Maybe I should have an aspirin dispenser on my desk.  </p>
