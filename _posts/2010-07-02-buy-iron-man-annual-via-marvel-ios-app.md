title: "Buy Iron Man Annual via Marvel iOS App"
---

I really encourage you to go buy [Invincible Iron Man Annual #1](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/07/02/numbercrunching-iron-man-annual-1/) via the Marvel Comics iOS app this week. It has been released on the same day as the print version and is really quite good. If we can tell publishers how we wish to consume their content with our wallets they will respond.
