Yes there was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_%28video_game%29#The_Game_Engine">PC based Blade Runner game</a> released in 97. Not many people played it but I did. It was awesome and now PC Gamer have finally given it a <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=169943">new write up</a>. The authenticity, the scope and the feel of the game was very unique. I always felt like I was doing real detective work rather than simply clicking on the correct pixel (or in this case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxel</a>) to find up the next item. The branching stories and multiple endings meant that you could replay this one several times over. I did last year, and once you get over the somewhat dated graphics it still holds up as a very deep game.

Shouting "enhance" at the screen has never been so much fun.
