I'm back folks.

Finished my final exam of my final year at university yesterday. I was out enjoying that fact most of yesterday, while recovering from the aftermath of that fact today.

It has been a hectic few weeks and I have had pleanty on my mind, which will no doubt be ejected onto this fine website and syndicated feedage soon. Just got back from the cinema (MI3 is great) and off to Alton Towers early tomorrow so hopefully have loads to say about those two things once I have more time tomorrow evening. Adios!
