How long ago was the nano-itx announced? It's a long time and it still isn't out on the shelves, I am one of the crazy people who put off buying a mini-itx system because I thought the nano would be out sometime this centaury. The last time I saw it was a segment by <a href="http://www.kevinrose.com">Kevin Rose</a> on the now defunct (or is that renamed) G4 show <em>The Screen Savers</em>.

The reason I bring this potential vapourware up is that VIA <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/embedded/archive/2005/04/06/405969.aspx">recently announced</a> it's successor codenamed 'Luke'. This thing is going to be even smaller than the nano but with their current record I have to wonder if this will ever see the light of day. If VIA spent more time getting their products fit for release instead of announcing new ones then they might get some business from me.
