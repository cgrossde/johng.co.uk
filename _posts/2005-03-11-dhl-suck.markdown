Worked from home today, got a lot done but the whole point in staying at home was because a DHL courier was picking up a parcel. I said the parcel would be ready for 10am and that 's what it says on the invoice. I don't hear anything all morning so I go down stairs look through the post and what do I find, a card saying the courier called in at 9:45am! This is a joke you give them such a wide time period to come and pick the thing up and they can't even get that right. Anyway I phoned <a href="http://www.interparcel.com">Interparcel</a> who I use as my middle men between myself and the couriers (highly recommended for home pickups) and they did me a free upgrade to a late UPS delivery on Monday. Thanks Interparcel, great service but a big shame DHL can't live up to their side of the bargain let 's just hope UPS can handle such a 'complicated' pickup on Monday.
