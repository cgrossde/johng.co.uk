[This talk](http://confreaks.net/videos/614-cascadiaruby2011-confident-code) from Avdi Grimm is essential viewing for Rubyists or just OO programmers in general. He has some very clever techniques for avoiding nil at all costs which can be easily added to your own development arsenal.

Warning - if you watch this you will find it even more frustrating to read through [poorly written libraries](https://github.com/puppetlabs/marionette-collective).
