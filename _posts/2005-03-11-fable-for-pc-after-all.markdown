After years of denying it Molyneux just went ahead at the GDC and <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000010035439/">announced Fable for PC</a>. There was a time that I was excited about seeing this come to PC but when he talks about putting back in the features they missed out on the Xbox version it doesn't fill me with hope.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000847035440/">Joystiq have more details</a> on what was left out of Fable including "Fable used to take place on multiple continents. It was so big that they had the world on a globe at one point." Nice!
