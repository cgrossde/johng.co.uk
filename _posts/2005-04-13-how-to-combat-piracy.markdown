The fine folks over at <a href="http://www.thepiratebay.org/">The Pirate Bay</a> sure know a thing or two about the world of international copyright law. When they recieved a warning to take down music on their Bit Torrent tracker by Enya from enya.com they responded with this nugget

<blockquote>Dear whatever-you-are,
thank you for providing us and our users with such great entertainment. I'm not talking about Enya (hey, Enya fucking sucks), but instead of your nonsensical email.</blockquote>

Great to see a pervayor of free flowing files stand up for themselves. More gems like this <a href="http://static.thepiratebay.org/legal/">here</a> (funny graphs at the bottom of the page).
