Dave is <a target="_self" href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/14#When:8:02:28AM">really pissed</a> after the Adam Curry <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,67525,00.html" target="_self">interview for Wired</a>, I guess everything in the media over the last few months has started to get to him. Their main point of contention is who wrote the first ipodder. Sure, Dave did write the first program to download enclosures from RSS feeds but Adam was the first to link that to iTunes and the iPod. It depends on what your definition of an ipodder or podcatching client is really, either way something is going down at Gnomedex.<br />
