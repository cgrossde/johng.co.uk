Just received my subscribers copy of PC Gamer and was shocked to turn the page and see a Mass Effect preview, previously only confirmed for Xbox 360. From the article,

> Mass Effect will come to PC (it's currently only announced for Xbox 360): it's not been officially confirmed but we have it on good authority. It's been three years since a BioWare developed game hit the PC: Mass Effect is a forceful reminder of why that's too damn long.

Not officially anounced by BioWare yet but you can be safe in the knowledge the PC Gamer UK is a trust worthy source and would never have taken this to press if it were false.

**UPDATE:**

Here are some photos of the mag taken with my camera phone (sorry that's all I have here right now)
