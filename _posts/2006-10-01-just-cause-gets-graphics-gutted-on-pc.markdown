It doesn't matter how powerful your PC is, Just Cause will never look as good as it does on the Xbox 360. Just take a look at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSCX8kVAwlA">video I posted to YouTube</a> below:

<object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/cSCX8kVAwlA"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/cSCX8kVAwlA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>

It's almost as if all the shadows and HDR effects have been ripped out of the game. Why short change PC players like this? The option to enable the features should at least be available to those will powerful enough hardware. Added to this the lack of native widescreen support makes this look more and more like a direct port on the Xbox (not 360) version. Bad move Eidos, haven't you ever heard of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/default.aspx">XNA</a>?
