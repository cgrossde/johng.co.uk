title: "Steam for MacOS Changes Everything"
---
With the [announcement](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/03/08/valve) that [Valve is bringing Steam to MacOS](http://store.steampowered.com/news/3569/) it seems like a good chance to see how we got here and look at the importance of what is to come. When you take the average Windows PC and the average MacOS computer, all differences aside on a software level, they should be able to play the same games. The reason why Windows pulled ahead (or away) from other computer platforms in gaming is because of Microsoft's introduction of [DirectX][] with Windows 95.

### DirectX Killed The Competition

By implementing their own proprietary layer in between the graphics hardware and game software, Microsoft were able to effectively stamp out cross platform development. [OpenGL][] had been the standard way to program to 3D graphics chips since the 3DFX days and was an open source, cross platform standard - allowing developers to compile for any platform that the compiler would run on.

Microsoft were able to offer more advanced features and become intertwined with the graphics card manufacturers to such an extent that they now rely on each other very heavily. New graphics hardware generations are now released along side new DirectX software. The release of the Xbox in 2001 further solidified DirectX now that it could be used in the console space (albeit only on the Xbox).

During this time OpenGL, while making advances, was never able to catchup to DirectX and win over game developers. There were a few exceptions such as the more traditional PC developers [id][] and [Epic][] who actually released Linux versions of the Quake and Unreal series respectively.

### Valve's Engineering Culture

In the last few years Microsoft's stock among enthusiasts has taken a nose dive and they have turned to Apple. It's no secret in the development and tech community that Macs are the computers of choice. We all enjoy using them so much that we knowingly accept it won't be possible to play the latest games under MacOS. The key developers and engineers at Valve will be no exception to this rule and it's why I feel they were able to forge ahead with this new strategy. They want to be able to play their games on the best hardware and software on the market.

I also believe Valve's strategy moving forward is to own as much of their stack as possible. This would include untethering Source and Steam from Windows and making it truly cross platform. Steam has seen such rapid growth in its users and platform offerings that to be reliant on Microsoft, who have been making their own plays in the digital games market, could be risky in the future. By making their store and primary engine cross platform they are guaranteeing their future.

### Growing Mac Market Share

Valve aren't ignoring the market share either. With strong growth among normal consumers in addition to enthusiasts and signs that Mac owners are more inclined to pay for software it is a market they can no longer ignore. Apple also have the mobile games market in the palm of their hands right now and although they control the storefront on the iPhone OS lets not forget that OpenGL games run on these devices too.

### A Bright Future

I am ecstatic about this announcement, I always believed Valve would take the lead in this and other studios are bound to follow. It makes sense for a business side and an engineering side and guarantees a bright future for Mac gaming.
