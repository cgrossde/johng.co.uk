<a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com">Songbird</a> has finally hit the net in very early version 0.1 form. It's looking very promising from my use of it today and certainly handles web based audio excellently. As for the library and jukebox functionality I have had a number of stability issues which should probablly be expected considering the size of the library and the early version of the software. It can get about half way through my music folder then it falls over but I am not supprised really.

Once the niggles are sorted out this player will be well on it's way to being the iTunes rival it sorely deserves to be. I am just glad the team got this release out there so we can see what they are up to and how we can help. Roll on summer for a full release candidate!

BTW if you having trouble getting hold of it Xeni has <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/08/songbird_the_open_so.html">posted some mirrors</a> up on BoingBoing.
