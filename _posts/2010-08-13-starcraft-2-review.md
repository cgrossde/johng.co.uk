title: "Starcraft 2 Review"
---
Starcraft 2 is a funny old game in a lot of ways. It's old and new at the same time and we have been waiting for it for a long long time.

###Ignoring Progress

At the gameplay level Blizzard have completely ignored all progress made in the rest of the RTS genre, be it the low level simplified tactics and action of Company of Heroes or the large scale strategic battles of Supreme Commander. Regardless of the reasons ([eSports](http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/314194#blog), [Korea](http://rossignol.cream.org/?p=284), etc) the game plays exactly the same as the original Starcraft from 12 years ago.

It's quite a ballsy move when you compare it to other franchises from the same year, Fallout 2 was released in 1998 and just look at how much Bethesda have evolved the series to keep it relevant. Oh and lets not forget Baldur's Gate - have you played Dragon Age?

###Refining a Legend

The real genius behind Starcraft 2 is that Blizzard realised they already had a fantastic, almost timeless, gameplay dynamic that they could build on, which is exactly what the single player campaign does. Each mission has been expertly crafted and finely tweaked so it's unique from all the others. You never get the feeling of mission repetition as you get in so many other RTSs. Rarely is it a case of destroy their base before they destroy yours and even when it is they provide an interesting twist.

The fantastic missions are backed up by a killer story that really propels you through the game. Blizzard can finally tell the story the way they want without restriction. It's also good to see them favour in game cut scenes more so than in the past, however key moments in the story are punctuated by gorgeous and dramatic CG cut scenes.

You are given a greater sense of choice between missions too. Money earned in missions can be used to purchase unit upgrades and mercenaries. If you discover Zerg and Protoss artefacts mid mission you get to research new units and crazy upgrades. And at some key points you can side with one faction or another to complete certain objectives.

###Zergy

So all in all despite the lack of gameplay innovation Blizzard have done so much with the top notch single player campaign that it alone is worth the price of entry. Of course there's multiplayer, skirmish mode and getting all those addictive achievements to keep you going in the long term. Even if you haven't played the original I highly recommend you give it a try.
