Major Nelson <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/04/11/gh-ii-song-packs-3-of-em.aspx">just announced</a> the downloadable tracks for Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360. Lets break down the cost.

500 points for 3 tracks. Thats ¬£1.42 per song. They are re-releases of Guitar Hero 1 tracks which featured 47 playable songs. So they value <em>the song library alone</em> of the original Guitar Hero at ¬£66.58!! I paid ¬£50 for Guitar Hero on PS2 with a guitar and the rest of the game. Bullshit! No deal Activision.
