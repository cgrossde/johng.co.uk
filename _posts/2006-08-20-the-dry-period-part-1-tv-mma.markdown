The last few weeks have been <em>very</em> dry in these parts. And no I am not referring to the weather, which continues in its randomness, but am talking about games and TV. All the good TV ends before the summer and starts up again in September and it has become much more noticable to me this year because I stay on the US TV schedule more than ever. They really don't have a clue how to space it out like we do in the UK. Of course there is the arguement that there are less eyeballs on the screen at this time of year, which might be true, but in an age of Tivos this is becoming less important. Last year Battlestar Galactica started in July which is extremely early and it didn't affect the ratings.

All this squashing of schedules leads to some almost hellish weeks during the start and end of the TV season. I remember earlier this year in January there was an insane week of stuff headlined by four hours of 24 along with Prison Break, Lost, BSG and the usuals. I am missing some out there but those alone are ridiculous and it's a fore gone conclusion that it will happen again multiple times this season.

There has even been a strange lack of MMA on over the last few weeks only to be totally shattered on Thursday by an awesome UFC show. But before that there had't been anything on apart from WFA a month prior. Of course there isn't much to moan about anymore as they are going for another 10 crazy days of programming - why can't they pace it! We have Fight Night, TUF4 Episode 1, All Access Babalu, UFC 62 Countdown, TUF4 Episode 2, UFC Live and Inside and then the UFC 62 pay per view!
This is all good stuff but I could be watching it nicely spaced out over a number of weeks rather than cramming it all in. Listen networks damn you!
