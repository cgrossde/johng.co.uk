title: Adventures with Thin Clients

I am essentially running a thin client in the loose sense of the word here at home over the Christmas break. My music, documents, code and many of my applications are still being stored and run on my box at uni. As such watching my newly aquired DVDs has proven to be quite the problem as the box I have here isn't equiped with a DVD drive.

The fact that I can't slap a DVD into another PC on our network and share it because of the copy protection is highly frustrating. Not even logging in through terminal services and firing up PowerDVD works, it recognises your remotely connected and blocks playback!

It's fair use out of the window once again.

It's far from ideal as you have no menu control or any control for that matter on the client system and have to keep going back to the server to do anything.

It may take a little longer than usual to get through the raft of DVDs I have recieved for Christmas this year.
