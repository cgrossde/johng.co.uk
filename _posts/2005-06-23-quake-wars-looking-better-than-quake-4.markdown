To be honest after seeing all the previews and videos of <a href="http://quake4.ravengames.com/">Quake 4</a> I was a little disapointed. Each of the last three games defined the FPS genre we know today and set standards for their peers. So it is a shame that it looks like <em>alot</em> like Doom 3 rather than being a unique entity. Of course, we all know how that turned out.

So I was delighted to see <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=57935">this video</a> of Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. Wow! Looks like they have really pushed the Doom 3 engine further than the Quake 4 team and have created a distinct and great looking game. This is the Quake I am most looking forward to.
