<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-684" title="header" src="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/header.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="134" />The time was right for a new venture so here it is, my new collaboration with Andy Griffiths is a site dedicated to Steam news and information that we like to call <a href="http://www.steamreport.com">Steam Report</a>.

Steam is where the most exciting things in PC gaming are happening right now. It's where I spend most of my PC gaming hours and it has a subscriber base larger than any of the major consoles. For this reason it only seems right that a dedicated site be created for such a wonderful community.

I very much hope you <a href="http://www.steamreport.com">bookmark it</a>, subscribe to the <a href="http://www.steamreport.com/feed">RSS feed</a> and perhaps even follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/steamreport">on Twitter</a>. As always we are open to feedback so <a href="http://www.steamreport.com/contact">drop us mail</a>, <a href="http://www.steamreport.com/2008/05/16/valve-getting-into-the-game-controller-business#respond">leave us a comment</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/steamreport">tweet us</a>!
