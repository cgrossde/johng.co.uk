My interest in Formula 1 was very lacking towards the end of the last season. It was strange really because finally Schumacher was losing but I wasn't enjoying it as much. This was probablly down to the bizzare rules that had been introduced that made the races less interesting.
So it's quite a breath of fresh air this weekend to see the sport reinvigorated by a return to tyre changing and a genuinely exciting qualifying session. If you gave up last year like I did, it's looking like it may be worth returning if it continues at this pace.
