I watched the TNA pay per view from Sunday. I watched it only for the Ultimate X match and to see what this damn announcement was, and boy was it damned. Kurt Angle, who formerly made the statement he was going to MMA, swerved us all and wound up in TNA this week as their latest signing. For some reason I didn¬ít expect it. I was genuinely shocked that they would take such risk with someone WWE fired because they simply didn¬ít want him to die in their ring.

For Angle TNA is the worst place he could go to and that includes MMA. At least in MMA he could have one or two big pay days per year and earn just as much as he would working every week in pro-wrestling. Pro-wrestling has done a ton of damage to his body so far and it¬ís only going to take a few more matches for him to totally break down.

It¬ís sad that they couldn¬ít take the moral high ground and leave him on the shelf where he belongs, it seems all they are thinking about are ratings and PPV buys. These may increase in the short term but if he dies while with the company they will surely plummet and the world will have lost one of the greatest ever.

Bad move.
