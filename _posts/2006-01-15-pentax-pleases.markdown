My camera, the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=johngblog-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;path=ASIN%2FB00031ZE3O%2Fqid%3D1137325977%2Fsr%3D8-3%2Fref%3Dsr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl">Pentax Optio S5i</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=johngblog-21&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2" />, had developed a dead pixel towards the end of 2005 so we sent it to back to them after the new year. Having just got the camera back yesterday and giving it a proper testing I can say for sure that the pixel has now gone!

This camera is still awesome and the returns procedure was smooth and painless. It's so rare we can say that these days. Thank you Pentax!
