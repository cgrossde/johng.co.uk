Back home now. The security in our building became a bit more relaxed around lunchtime and allowed people to go out and get food as long as they came back quickly. Of course they were inspecting bags on the way back in because of the raised terror alert, amazing how we are all supposedly carrying bombs after working there for goodness knows how long. Due to the major delays on rail services people were allowed to finish work early so I took the opportunity come home. No buses running in Zone 1 so I just walked the 40 or 50 minutes it takes along the Southbank. Lots of people on the streets and a kind of eerie silence in air. Quite a day.
