I'd buy one. Especially if <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/11/30.html#theRojaswinercalacanisPodcastDevice">Dave Winer</a> <a href="http://roj.as/entries/2006/11/25/next-or-not/">and</a> <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/11/26/the-rojas-mp3-player/">company</a> design it the way it's meant to be - which I know they can. On the software side I think something could come of hooking up with <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a>, the free, open source, cross platform player. It would probably be much easier to adapt the source, develop an extension or work directly with the Songbird team to provide the software needed to manage subscriptions on the device. So how about it Dave?
