The <a href="http://www.twit.tv">TWIT podcast</a> is a nice weekly show about gadgets and technology produced by the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screen_Savers">Screen Savers</a> team from TechTV. For some reason after the first or second show <a href="http://www.leoville.com/">Leo Laporte</a> decided he wanted a cash injection and started to promote listeners to get a paid subscription or make a one off donation. Of course this is entirely optional but many people have pledged their support and paid up.

A few weeks later problems started showing up and they were extremely late (6 days) putting it together and releasing it onto the net. Now if you pledge to release you show on a certain day every week <em>and</em> ask people to pay, optional though it may be, you should abide by that promise and not keep <a href="http://thisweekintech.com/node/3723">coming</a> <a href="http://thisweekintech.com/node/3779">up</a> <a href="http://thisweekintech.com/node/3780">with</a> <a href="http://thisweekintech.com/node/3815">excuses</a>.

If this were a completely free arrangement then there would be no issue, they could release as few as they liked whenever they liked and no one would care. But by actively seeking donations they should be living up to their end of the bargain and not abusing the trust of the loyal TechTV audience.

Leo sparked this post by <a href="http://thisweekintech.com/node/3816">offering a full refund</a> to anyone who wants one on the TWIT blog today. This is beside the point. They should have let the show run for several weeks to iron out bugs before even contemplating asking for money.
