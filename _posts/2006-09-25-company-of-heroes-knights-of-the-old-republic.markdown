Strange I know but there is a huge similarity between Company of Heroes and Knights of the Old Republic. As Gillen puts it in today's <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=67931">Eurogamer review of Company of Heroes</a>, both World War 2 and Star Wars had been ran into the ground before these games rejuvenated their respective universes and made it fun again.

We are all sick to death of World War 2, I cannot see myself playing the next Call of Duty or Medal of Honour games (I'd had enough after Brothers in Arms 2), but Company of Heroes is simply on another level. It does for its setting and genre what KOTOR did for Star Wars and RPGs.

<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=67931"><img id="image326" alt="coh" src="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/00002440.jpg" /></a>

I have never had this much fun playing an RTS, I constantly feel challenged and every time I play it's different. I just hope those who feel nauseous at the prospect of more WW2 don't miss this stellar title.

Incidentally it's good too see they weren't afraid to awarded it a 10 over at EG. <a href="http://www.pcgamerpodcast.com/?p=92">This week's PC Gamer podcast</a> (<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/24/with-pod-on-lockdown-apple-goes-after-podcast/">should I use that term?</a>) had an outstanding discussion on the topic of scoring games in reviews if the intricacies of games journalism interest you. Definitely their best show to date.

Anyway back to COH.
