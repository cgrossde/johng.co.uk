The site has been experiencing some down time over the week and not for a particularly good reason. My hosting provider <a href="http://www.fasthosts.co.uk">fasthosts</a> decided to scramble the passwords of all their user's accounts making webspace, databases and other services inaccessible. Due to a security breach they felt it necessary to post the new passwords by old fashioned snail mail.

Bad move.

The first thing I did when receiving the password was to start moving the blog. This site is now brought to you by <a href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>. And it seems slightly faster don't you think?
