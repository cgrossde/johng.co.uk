I have been beta testing the Windows XP version of Orb that allows you to stream audio and video content from your PC to any web browser be it mobile, desktop or whatever. I was sure this service would cost something eventually as they were charging for the Media Centre edition when it was first released. But as <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/29.html#a9763">Robert Scoble points out</a> it looks like its going to be <a href="http://www.orb.com/aboutUs/press,50">free</a>!

It's a great service and you should check it out if you have ever felt the need to watch you media content on the go. I remember a few months back Scoble was claiming this as the killer app for Media Centre, but now you don't need a MC PC and it's free so scratch that as MS won't be shifting anymore MC boxes as a result of this.
