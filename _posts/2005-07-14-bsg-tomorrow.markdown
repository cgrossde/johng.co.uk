The second season of Battlestar Galactica starts tomorrow and by now everyone is salivating at the prospect of another blistering year with Starbuck, Apollo and crew. The last season went so well and was just paced perfectly so it will be interesting to see if Ron Moore can continue his form this time around.

I watched the first season's finale last week just to refresh my memory and it really is an astounding piece of television that was answering so many questons but at the same time throwing up a whole load more. Caprica Boomer is up the duff with a Human-Cylon hybrid and ready to deliver to Gyus, BSG Boomer just shot Adama, Apollo screwed his Dad and Starbuck has the arrow she was sent to pickup. Just a few things to start this season off with then ;-)
