If you don't buy The Orange Box this year you are quite literally INSANE. Comprising of Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Episode 2, Portal and Team Fortress 2 makes for INSANE value for money. There is not a better deal out there. Buy it now!

Team Fortress 2 I have been playing excessively since the beta first started and would say it's worth it for that alone. Multiplayer shooters have come out at that price individually before - Shadowrun anyone? But this is on another level to that particular game as there is something for every type of player from casual (medic, engineer) to the hardcore (soldier, spy) and it's so much fun.

I finished Episode 2 yesterday and as usual the quality is sky high. Valve is all about polish polish polish and this instalment just shines. The plot was explained much better this time around and definitely gave off a middle of the trilogy feeling what with the not so happy ending. Alyx remains the most convincing in game character I have ever seen and, by your side or not, much of the story rests on her convincing performances. I hope Episode 3 isn't far away but Valve being Valve they could make us wait another 16 months for the next instalment.

Last but not least is Portal which I completed in one sitting. Compelling, original, funny, twisted and more. We all knew the technology was there to make for a great puzzler but they went a step further and crafted something with character and depth. Also being set in the Half-Life universe (at Apature Science, Black Mesa's rival) is a great idea and it would love to see some overlap in Episode 3 down the line.

Good work Valve! I look forward to the next box whatever colour it is.
