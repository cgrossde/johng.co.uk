Come home for a few days this week, my birthday and a certain pay per view should make it an excellent week :-). Good train journey up, never find it too taxing when I have something to read and Dave Meltzer's newsletter was particularly good this week.

Thought I would do a scan for wireless networks while I was here and low and behold there is another wide open network in range of the house. Simply called 'dave', I am pretty sure this is coming from the house over the road, don't talk to them and don't really know them but I am more than happy to use their Internet access. Typically for an insecure wireless network they still have the default password for the linksys router they are using (username:<em>n/a</em> password:admin). Might re flash it with some custom firmware if I get the chance.

Acoustic guitar also showed up here so now I have a guitar for when I come back here! Very good for the money and although my tuning abilities are pretty minimal I managed to get it sounding pretty good after some searching on google for a good guide.
