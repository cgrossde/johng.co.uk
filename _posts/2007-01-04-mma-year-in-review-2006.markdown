The biggest and best year for MMA yet has just wrapped up and there are no signs the sport is slowing down yet. We have seen the continued dominance of Chuck Liddell, Cro Cop finally winning the big one and the defeat of Matt Hughes.

<strong>Best Division:</strong> UFC Welterweight
One glance at the <a href="http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/topten.asp?articleid=13&zoneid=15">MMA Weekly rankings</a> is evidence enough that this division is deep. Some of the best matches have been fought within it and competition is extremely close at the top.

<strong>Worst Division:</strong> UFC Heavyweight
Tim Sylvia has become a joke. Our only hope now is that Mirko goes in there and high kicks his head off ASAP.

<strong>Favourite Fighter:</strong> Mirko Cro Cop
In 2006 we saw a renewed Cro Cop who managed to take out Wanderlei Silva and Josh Barnett on the same night, becoming Pride's new open weight tournament champion. His signing to the UFC this week capped off an impressive year.

<strong>Favourite Match:</strong> Matt Hughes vs BJ Penn (UFC 63)
It's something truly incredible when Matt Hughes comes back from the brink of defeat to win a match so decisively. He did it again here much like he did against Frank Trigg the second time they met. He shows a toughness and stamina that no one else can match, if you give him an inch he will take a mile.

<strong>Favourite Moment:</strong> GSP Finally Wins the Belt (UFC 65)
After all the hype was over and the injuries had healed GSP got his title shot and defeated Matt Hughes in impressive style. A complete dominance of someone who at the time was considered one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world. After all the hard work it finally came through for him.

<strong>Worst Moment:</strong> Pride Losing Japanese TV
The loss of TV due to the Mafia scandal has done tremendous damage to Pride. The chances of Pride coming out of 2007 intact are not looking promising.

<strong>Worst Trend:</strong> Champions having non-title fights
I'm looking at you Gomi. You crazy crazy elf.

<strong>Best Match that Never Happened:</strong> Chuck Liddell vs Wanderlei Silva
Dana teased us but Pride didn't deliver. The dream match of last year still hasn't taken place and won't be happening anytime soon. MMA needs this fight in 2007. Make it happen!
