In Adam's <a href="http://www.curry.com/DSC/DSC-2005-03-09">March 9th Daily Source Code</a> he talks about bringing games and podcasting together. This was in responce to an email recieved about the radio stations in Grand Theft Auto Vice City, but as Adam isn't a gamer and I feel he slightly missed the point. This is really about incorporating podcasts into games like GTA and treating them as the normal radio stations while in game, a pretty simple thing to do - just download the podcasts into the GTA music folder (or the soundtracks area on the Xbox) and your all set. But Adam talked about getting the tools that have been created by the developers (Rockstar North) to record these stations into the public domain. This isn't going to happen because all they did to record the stations was mix the tracks and the DJ voices like any professional radio station would do and also even if the software did exist it would not be released as it would be an internal development tool. Podcasting and gaming have a great future together but it will more like the <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/wp/index.php">Major Nelson</a> (Xbox Live team) podacast than developers providing tools.
