title: Heroes Season 2 Is Disappointing

The second season of Heroes came to end rather quickly and disappointingly after the huge success of last year. While it certainly turned a corner by the 8th episode it all seemed too little too late. This was incidentally the episode that told the events right after the end of season one and finally ditched Hiro's wacky adventures in medieval Japan. Why on Earth they couldn't just do this in the first place is beyond me - it makes far more sense and actually explained what happened to the characters after the big finale. Dumb.

The other thing that has been nagging at me are the logic holes. A man who can manipulate time itself would have no problem handling every situation and saving anybody. Hiro has become too powerful and breaks the show because of this. The guy really needs to be restricted to just pausing time.

Also in the last two episodes it's established that Peter and Adam can be killed by a bullet through the head. Yet before this Noah is shot in the head, killed and then promptly resurrected via a transfusion of Claire's blood. The same Claire whose powers Peter absorbed and as such you would assume the same rules apply to her as to any blood transfusion.

I haven't even started on my outright hatred for Maya and Niki - so pointless. Hopefully the writer's strike will give them time to reflect on the issues this season has had so they come back with swinging next year. Hopefully.
