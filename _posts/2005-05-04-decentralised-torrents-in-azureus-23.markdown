Last night I was greeted by the <a target="_self" href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> auto updater when I fired up my favourite Bit Torrent client. It's been a long time coming but with version 2.3.0.0 we now have <a target="_self" href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/whatsnew2300.php">decentralised torrents</a>. This means that each client hold a tracker style list of other clients so that even when disconnected from a central tracker the transfer will continue. On the what's new page there is also a mention of magnet links - torrents that never started with a tracker in the first place. Our swarms will never be stopped now.<br />
