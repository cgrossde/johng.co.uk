It's been coming in fast all day and I just want to say big hardy FUCK OFF to all the spammers hitting my blog.

I didn't want to but I have introduced a temporary limitation on all comments coming in - they must be approved by me first. Once you get approval you should be set. Hopefully this won't last too long and <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> will finally kick in.

**UPDATE: **Fasthosts sent me this, from my tests it looks like no external services can be accessed from the site.
<blockquote>We are aware that recent changes to the network configuration of our shared hosting platform have caused a number of our customers problems, specifically in relation to connections from their websites to external providers of services such as XML interfaces and feeds. Our network team are currently preparing a fix for this problem which will be applied to the platform as soon as testing is complete. We hope that this work will be completed today.

We apologise for the inconvenience that this has caused. We advise any of our customers who have pages dependent on external services which are currently inaccessible to consider temporarily removing these dependencies.</blockquote>
So just waiting on these guys to fix the problem before normal service can resume.

**UPDATE 2: **Akismet is on. Let the floodgates open!
