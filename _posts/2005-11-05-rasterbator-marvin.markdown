Check out the huge (6x6 A4) Sin City print I made featuring Marvin. <a href="http://arje.net/rasterbator">Rasterbator</a> takes any image you feed it, splits it up into loads of pages, rasterizes it and spits out a printable PDF. It seems to work best with two tone images like this but with a bit of tweaking colour images also come out nicely.

Only the ceiling and every wall in the flat to go.
