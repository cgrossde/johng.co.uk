Didn't see any of the other MMA blogs pick this up. On the most <a href="http://www.pcgamerpodcast.com/?p=174">recent episode</a> of the PC Gamer podcast they had <a href="http://www.jenspulver.com/">Jens Pulver</a> on to talk Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and more. He goes into a ton of detail about the games he plays, his old clan and shows a deep appreciation for gaming that you don't hear often from athletes. Turns out he even has a deal with Activision to sponsor him for his debut fight in WEC next week against Cub Swanson.
