The <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1444303,00.html">BBC announced today</a> that the person responsible for the Dr Who leak in Canada has been fired. It still feels intentional to me though, they have managed to create a huge buzz just by leaking the first episode and that buzz continues with more stories like this popping up every week. As The Guardian points out its great timing just days before its shown on British TV. Eccleston's comments were overkill though.

<blockquote>At the time Eccleston described the leak as "sick", urging fans not to download the copy and wait for the legal broadcast on BBC1.</blockquote>

So he believes license fee payers are not allowed to watch this however they choose, the new doctor should be happy that people want to see it that badly instead of worrying about Saturday's ratings, ratings shouldn't affect a public service broadcaster but its clear with the beeb they do.

It's sick that the BBC spun this story in first place.
