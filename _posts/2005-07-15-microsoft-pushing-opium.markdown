Over at Engadget there is an <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000143050582/">column</a> on the future of monitor and display based DRM in Windows Longhorn. From the article,

<blockquote>If OPM determines that your monitor falls below the security restrictions (i.e. isn¬ít DVI or HDMI w/HDCP), you could be greeted with a ¬ìpolite message explaining that [your monitor] doesn¬ít meet security requirements.¬î</blockquote>

Ok this is getting ridiculous. Why are the studios suddenly crapping themselves over HD content and demanding this level of protection must be integrated into the OS? They shift tons of DVDs every day and it will be a drop in the ocean if a couple of people manage to pipe the HD output from their PC and record it onto another medium.

Whats that I hear? Oh yes, fair use is being flushed down the toilet.
