<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7103668/" target="_self">Great article</a> over at MSNBC about the future of human evolution, kind of the opposite of what I was <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/04/13/67/" target="_self">talking about</a> last month. I think the Unihuman concept is only going to happen when the entire world becomes globalised, so that won't happen anytime in the next few centuries, more like a few thousand years.</p><p>The excellent Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson goes into what happend to the children born on Mars is great detail. With a third of Earth's gravity they became much taller and thinner making them incredibly weak in higher g environments. After a few generations the ones that try to return to Earth simply cannot take it and must remain on Mars. So basically any planet we settle will wind up with a whole different species of human living there. Got your ticket booked for the Mars colony ship yet? :-)<br /> </p><p>[<a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/05/05/15/1216216.shtml?tid=191&tid=126&tid=14" target="_self">via Slashdot</a>]<br /> </p>
