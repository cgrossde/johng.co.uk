There is a feature in space based games, whether it's a combat sim or in this case an MMO, that I have been waiting a long time for. That feature is smooth transitions from space to a planet's surface and back again without interruption and it looks like <a href="http://www.fl-tw.com/Infinity/">Infinity</a> is going to finally deliver the goods.

So far it's looking very promising and they already have a stunning planetary model working with some drool inducing effects as you enter and leave a planet's atmosphere. Just check out the videos in the media section on the site to see the potential this thing has. Hopefully a decent game will come from all this as they have an awseome backbone of an engine to build off. It may even give <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/">EVE Online</a> a run for it's money (congrats on 100,000 users CCP by the way)!
