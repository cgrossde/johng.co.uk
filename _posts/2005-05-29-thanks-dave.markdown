<p>I listened to Dave's <a href="http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cnMay26.mp3" target="_self">Morning Coffee Notes</a> where he explains what happend between him and Adam over Podshow. If Adam knowingly lied to him about going into business then that's not cool and I would really like to hear what he has to say about that. It seems like Dave and Ron never got on and it was going to be one or the other who would become partners with Curry - not both. Unfortunately a verbal agreement on Dave's side was not enough to secure a deal as Ron Bloom had already managed to put a wall between the two of them. It would be nice if they could patch things up as it would be great for the entire podcasting community, whether or not Dave is willing to forgive though remains to be seen.<br /> </p>
