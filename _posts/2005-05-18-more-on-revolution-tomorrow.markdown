Big thanks to Andy for pointing this out. There may be more info about the Revolution <a target="_self" href="http://nintendonow.com/index.php?categoryid=5&m_articles_articleid=2635&PHPSESSID=c24344b74ec2f9bf72f944edbc92841c">revealed at E3 tomorrow</a> on day two of the show, if they do it's going to shock everyone especially after the lack of detail yesterday. I just watched the <a target="_self" href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/613/613578p1.html">fan created video</a> over at IGN and the mention of brain in the clip bears a striking resemblance to what Reggie was saying yesterday about the 'right brain'. If this is true and Nintendo are returning to VR with a new approach then I will buy one on day of release - no question.<br />
