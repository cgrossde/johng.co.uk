UFC announcer Joe Rogan has made another classic outburst this week, he's trying his best but I still don't think it tops his [endorsement of DMT](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/18/joe_rogan_rants_on_t.html).

> In the "I hope I never waste my time on something like this department," UFC announcer Joe Rogan, responding to someone on MySpace who e-mailed him in public to say "I hate you. You're not funny." After back-and-forth, Kevin whomever wrote to him, "You're only accomplishment in my memory is taking a highly successful show (The Man Show) and running it into the ground merely by your presence alone. I also don't think playing second-fiddle to Brooke Shields is much of an accomplishment." Rogan wrote back, "I was never on a show with Brooke Shields. I was, however, on two shows that made it to syndication, Fear Factor and Newsradio, which means I never have to worry about money for the rest of my life. Think about that when you're getting told what to do by your boss and struggling to pay your bills. I agree that the Man Show sucked, but unfortunately, there wasn't a whole lot I could do about it at the time. I did, however, make a fuckload of money from it, and had the time of my life. You're an ugly, fat faced zero, and I'm a famous multi millionaire. Those are the facts there, dear sweet Kevin."
