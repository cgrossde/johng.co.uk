title: "News Overload"
---
There is a [great episode](http://5by5.tv/conversation/29) of The Conversation up at 5by5[^1] which starts to dig into a topic I have been thinking about for a few years, news overload. Dan and Mike discuss this problem and point to RSS and Twitter as major time sinks that could be overcome with clever filtering technology.

### History

I have used RSS aggregators since the [Radio Userland](http://radio.userland.com/) days. I then moved onto [Newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com) and have been using [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) since [2006](http://www.johng.co.uk/2006/12/20/switched-to-google-reader/), all the while increasing the number of feeds I read and receiving a greater volume of content from each feed. It got to a point [last year](http://www.johng.co.uk/2009/07/22/are-feed-readers-dead/) that I had to go through a massive cull and rethink the way I was consuming news. Now I'm in a middle ground where I actively add and remove feeds on a regular basis to keep control of the flow.

### What's Out There

I have tried to use a number of different smart aggregators but they all fall short.
* [Fever](http://feedafever.com/) isn't smart enough and gives either a lot of duplicates or stories that I'm not interested in.
* Dedicated sites like [Techmeme](http://www.techmeme.com) only cover a single topics and there are very few of them around.
* Twitter, which is essentially a crowd sourced filter, misses a ton of interesting content out there.

I even developed my own dedicated site called [Splitstate](http://www.splitstate.com) which serves as an auto aggregator/filter for gaming news in a similar fashion to Techmeme. It was a tough project with a ton of unexpected pitfalls during its development but it gave me some insight into the news filtering problem. Best of all it works and I use it everyday[^2].

### Taking News To The Next Level

The current news filters such as Techmeme and Splitstate do fundamentally basic things - analyse news feeds within a limited scope and try to find common threads between them, the more talked about a subject is the more prominence it's given on a page. To move things to the next level we will need to do a lot more than this.

This software will need to analyse you - what you are interested in, talk about and do online. It will need to source data from Twitter, Facebook and other sites to give you a more personal news stream. It should also be capable of prioritising significant world news so that even topics outside of your normal reading habits are brought to the fore. It should also be able to learn and adapt as you skip over or read articles in detail. Likewise it should recognise changes in taste over time and adjust accordingly.

To put it lightly, **this is a massive undertaking**, but the first developer that can get a working product out will be greatly rewarded. It's going to take overcoming this massive engineering hurdle for people to fully turn of their feed readers.
