Out of all the things we could have bought for our flat we went to the extreme and bought a huge air hockey table. It was a pinch at just over ¬£100 from eBay with no delivery fee courtosy of borowed van followed by a local pickup. Lugging the thing up six flights of stairs was a sight to behold and we got our fair share of funny looks but it was worth it in the end.
