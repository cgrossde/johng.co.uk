I never followed up my <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2009/02/27/3-things-i-want-from-a-google-reader-iphone-app/">previous post</a> but I found far and away the best app for reading RSS on the iPhone is <a href="http://www.phantomfish.com/byline.html">Byline</a>. It syncs brilliantly with Google Reader and the caching features are great, buy it now!
