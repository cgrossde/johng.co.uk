Hey check it out - there is a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/05/31/the-summer-gaming-drought-is-upon-us/">gaming drought</a>!

Woohoo a chance to catch up! Oh hang on a minute <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v2/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=380">Half-Life 2: Episode 1</a> is out this afternoon. I have preordered mine so that should keep me busy well into the night (assuming Steam holds up).

**UPDATE:** Just found the <a href="http://ep1.half-life2.com/">countdown clock</a> for it. Looks like it is going to be out 6pm UK time.
