The end may be <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2005/11/16/reaction-to-arrested-development-cancellation-was-swift-says-observer-article/">near</a> for <a href="http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/">Arrested Development</a> but it hasn't stopped them from pleading to <a href="http://www.hbo.com">other</a> <a href="http://www.sho.com">networks</a> to pick the show up next season,
