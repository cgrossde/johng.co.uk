The latest in <a href="http://www.star-force.com/">Starforce</a>'s recent atrocities, if you can believe it, is to develop a <a href="http://www.onlinesecurity-on.com/">fake security news site</a> that <a href="http://www.onlinesecurity-on.com/protect.phtml?c=55">claims their DRM is safe</a>. The idiots even <a href="http://www.star-force.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=841">linked to it</a> in their own forums and were promptly exposed when a regular <a href="http://whois.sc/onlinesecurity-on.com">WHOIS lookup</a> revealed they were the owners of the domain.

Add this to the list of recent bad press they have recieved and it's shocking that Ubisoft can continue to support this corrupt immoral company. Only recently we have had the <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/legal/5m-class-action-lawsuit-against-ubisoft-for-starforce-164303.php">legal action</a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/31/starforce_threatens_.html">paranoia towards bloggers</a>, Starforce <a href="http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/13212">linking to torrent sites</a> and the <a href="http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/13212">ongoing issues</a> people who <em>legally</em> buy Starforce protected games have to go through.

I am a huge advocate of developers protecting their income, people should buy games, but Starforce is the single worst thing to happen to the industry in a long time. There are other ways and although there may have been initial issues, Valve's Steam is still the best. Online activation people, it's not hard.

While Ubisoft the other smaller publishers who use it still have their heads up their arses some of us will be <a href="http://www.glop.org/starforce/">boycotting</a> these <a href="http://www.glop.org/starforce/list.php">games</a>.
