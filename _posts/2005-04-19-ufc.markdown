<p><img width="150" vspace="0" hspace="5" height="100" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/images/12098_sm.jpg" alt="12098_sm.jpg" title="12098_sm.jpg" />Finally got around to watching UFC 52 last night, I couldn't catch it on Bravo on Sunday night so I <a href="http://mma-tracker.org">downloaded it</a> but that didn't complete till the early hours of Monday morning so I was more than anxious to see it.</p><p>Match of the night was probably the Welterweight title bout, I totally thought Matt Hughes was going to get choked out when Trigg got it locked in but some how he managed to power out and then later on finish it off with the same move. The fact that their last fight also ended with a rear naked choke would have made it very ironic if Matt Hughes had lost to the move he won with last time.</p><p>After all the hype and the many months of waiting Couture versus Liddell was over in just over two minutes in the first round. I was a little disappointed as I was hoping for a long war between these guys but Chuck knocked Randy out fair and square, the first time ever I believe. So we have a new light heavyweight champ, shame there is no one to defend against unless we have Randy vs Chuck 3 ;-).</p><p>Just a quick note on UFC president Dana White. I don't think this man has actually slept or stopped moving in the last two weeks. With the <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/04/10/the-ultimate-fighter-final/">Ultimate Fighter finale</a> last week, the PPV this week and the fact that he is still trying to sort out fights for other shows and a new deal with Spike TV he must be knackered. In his appearance on <a href="http://www.liveaudiowrestling.com">Live Audio Wrestling</a> he sounded worn out and really tired, this guy has really got to get a vice president to help him out because as this company grows he will not be able to juggle everything. Vince McMahon can do it, but he has much more control of his company and product.</p><p>It's a great time to be watching UFC and I am really looking forward to what they come up with next. Come on Dana, get the weekly fight show that we all want.</p>
