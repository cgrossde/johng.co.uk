Finally made it back to Solihull after the car decided to crap out on me just when I was ready to leave. Note to self - always keep jumper cables in the car. This festive period will give me some time to catch up on some blogging, watch some wacky Japanese MMA and get through a ton of films. Oh and there's this whole thing involving eating and drinking too much which will no doubt be taking place simultaneously with the rest of my activities. Woo!
