Just got the weekly newsletter from PC Gamer UK and looks like the big scoop they have is the Half-Life 2 expansion pack:

> This is the expansion pack we've all been waiting for, and PC Gamer has the first details on the next chapter (for it is just that: a chapter) in the Half-Life 2 universe. Everyone wants to know, and we have the first details. We went to Valve, talked the ears off them and came away with the blueprints and some screenshots.

We also got to look at the Lost Coast, Valve's attempt to bring photo-realism to the Source engine, and DoD: Source which is the next full game from the Seattle stable.

I had [reported on The Lost Coast before](http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/03/31/46/) (although I am sure Lombardi said Codes ;-)) after it [appeared on "Attack of the Show"](http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/03/25/new-half-life-expansion-on-g4techtv-this-week/) but this looks like the real expansion now. My issue should turn up the week of April 14th.

**UPDATE:** PC Gamer broke this early because it's now public knowlege thanks to [Eurogamer](http://eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=58579).
