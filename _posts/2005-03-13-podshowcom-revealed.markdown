Looks like the veil is off the secret project Adam Curry and others have been working on. Adam <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/03/13#a3747">posted today</a> about changes to <a href="http://www.ipodder.org">iPodder.org</a> and on the front page of that site there is now a large button that points to <a href="http://www.podshow.com">PODSHOW.com</a> which appears to be the secret venture being undertaken. Looks like a tool to bring together producers, on-air talent and advertisers in one easy to manage pot. It seems promising and we will probably see more professional podcasts as people move into their preferred area on production, as well as money making opportunities which have so far been nonexistent.
