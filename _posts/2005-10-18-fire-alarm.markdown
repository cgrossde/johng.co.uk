We had our first fire alarm here last night, of what will surely be the first of many, at the unholy hour of 4am. To say zombies were crawling out of their rooms would be an understatement.

To be honest I expected this to have happend sooner. It's a regular deal in student halls and at one point in my first year it seemed like every week someone was setting them off.
