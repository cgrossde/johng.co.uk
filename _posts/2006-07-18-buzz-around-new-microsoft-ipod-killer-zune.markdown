If the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/17/but-wait-theres-more-zune-deets/">buzz</a> around the new Microsoft iPod competitor strangely named Zune is true then we could see the player out by next year. The specs seems pretty tasty (aside from the 30 gig drive) but most of the <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/07/17/reading-the-microsoft-portable-media-player-tea-leaves/">speculation</a> centres around the possibilities of a WiFi connection. The possibilities of streaming media, Live Anywhere and just hands down wire free file transfer would make it a <em>very </em>atractive alternative.

It's about time the iPod had some legitimate competition and with Apple's lack of new models this year it may be the perfect for Microsoft to strike.
