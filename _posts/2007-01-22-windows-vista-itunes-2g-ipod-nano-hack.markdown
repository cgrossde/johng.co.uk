The only way I have been able to get some usefulness out of my second gen <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2007/01/18/itunes-syncing-of-2g-ipod-nano-fails-in-windows-vista/">iPod Nano in Vista</a> was like this:

<ol>
	<li>Hook it up to a Windows XP PC with the latest iTunes.</li>
	<li>Restore the iPod to factory settings and do a clean format.</li>
	<li>Once complete don't sync anything, just check the manually manage iPod box.</li>
	<li>Plug into Vista PC with clean iTunes installation.</li>
	<li>Try and sync podcasts. This works but attempting to do so with any music playlists doesn't. You can however drag over the playlists you need manually.</li>
</ol>

This should tide us over till Apple release an update.
