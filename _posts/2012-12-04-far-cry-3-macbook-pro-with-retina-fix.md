This works for me when booting into Windows 7.

- Navigate to your Far Cry 3 installation folder, usually c:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\FarCry3 (or wherever Steam is installed).
- Go into the bin folder.
- Right click on farcry3_d3d11.
- Click Compatibiliy
- Check "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings"
- Apply
- Play the game.

Fixes the flickering black screen problem when first loading and allows the game to run in fullscreen mode.
