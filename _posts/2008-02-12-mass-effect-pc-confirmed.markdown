After <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2006/10/21/breaking-news-mass-effect-coming-to-pc-in-2007/">announcing it here over a year ago</a> and having to endure a bit of crap about it from various people (including Bioware), Mass Effect has now been <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=182157&amp;site=cvg">officially confirmed</a> as coming to the PC in May. This year. Yes its a 6 month delay. Thanks for being honest from the start Bioware!?!
