I got so sick and tired of trying to get my USB wifi adapter to work in Ubuntu that I gave up and ordered a <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&amp;scid=35&amp;prid=610" target="_self">Linkysys WRT54GS</a> that can be used as a bridge (with <a href="http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000690043237/" target="_self">hacked firmware</a>). Of course a few hours after ordering I got the thing working!! If you install the latest <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/" target="_self">ndiswrapper</a> it works great with Windows XP drivers, I followed <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/SetupNdiswrapperHowto/view?searchterm=ndis" target="_self">this guide</a> to nail it all down. The router will come in handy for some other projects I have lined up though, can you say &quot;<a target="_self" href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050414.html">a cup of internet</a>&quot;?<br />
