I have been meaning to hookup my family with wifi for a while now and today I got the chance. It was also a chance to finally ditch that god awful USB ADSL 'modem' they have had since getting broadband all those years ago. Coming home and connecting up to a 10mbit LAN with using ICS felt so bad on so many levels I can't even begin to describe. So I went for the <a href="http://www1.linksys.com/international/product.asp?coid=6&amp;ipid=371">Linksys WAG54G</a> to kill two birds with one stone, it gives us a nice bit of 802.11G and that extra layer of security and stability that no USB device can provide.

When I am back here I tend to connect my Xbox up to the big screen in the living room and stream video down from my PC upstairs using <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.de/">XBMC</a>. Of course this is a cabling nightmare as we don't have CAT5 in the walls (does anyone?). A few months ago I <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/05/29/wireless-usb-in-ubunutu/">bought a WRT54GS</a>, that goes unused while I am here, so I have fully reconfigured it to work with the xbox in client mode. It's working great so far, I am able to stream video from any system on the network and it pulls stuff of the internet very quickly. I'm sure if I tried some HD stuff it would fall over but for Xvid it works very nicely. The firmware from <a href="www.sveasoft.com">Sveasoft</a> does the trick nicely.
