Awaiting the release of Forza 2 on Friday (stupid timing Microsoft) I got some time to play Tomb Raider Anniversary over the weekend and what a nice suprise that was. I'm only about half way through the PC version but already it's clear this is the best Tomb Raider since the original. The focus on RAIDING TOMBS rather than SHOOTING GOONS makes this re-imaging feel closer to the original concept of the series than any other. The platforming elements are fluid and flexible making all the areas really fun to explore.

The one part it does fall down on is in combat which, as noted, is not what the series does well. You get to shoot your way through a plethora of endangered species such as Snow Leopards and Gorillas and it still feels as hokey as ever. While I applaud the lack of humans to kill and the severely reduced occurrences of combat I'd still like to see more done to get rid of it or change it completely. It's only there to fill the gaps between the platforming sections with more action orientated play anyway.

Either way I believe this is well worth picking up especially with it coming out at a lower price. There are plenty of unlockables and extras to keep you coming back and the graphics look remarkably good for a PS2 game.
