I got the Antec P180 PC case several weeks ago and have yet to post my thoughts. It's a very well made case, extremely robust and sturdy and without any sharp edges (I am still haunted by a scar from being cut to the bone on my right index finger on a sharp case).

All this robustness does come at a cost and that would be the weight. Unlike my last 'bag-o-crap' case that looked cool, if you dropped this thing half a metre from the ground it wouldn't shatter into a million pieces. The case looks elegant and although it may not be glistening with the neon blue lighting and side windows of old it rises above that with great attention to detail and more of a Mac G5 way of case design.

I thought the door would be a problem but it actually reduces noise from the drive bays and internal fans. It also nicely conceals my beige DVD drives which I will not be painting any time soon, and lets face it, with networking and USB media those drives are seeing less and less use these days.

Internally everything is well made and I was very happy with the lower chamber for housing the power supply and hard drives. Everything down there is nice and cool in its own isolated area and all screws and mounts are padded using rubber grommets to prevent vibration.

Superb case overall and I would highly recommend it if you need a cool, quiet, good looking system and don't mind the weight or size. Now I just have to cart it to uni...rats!
