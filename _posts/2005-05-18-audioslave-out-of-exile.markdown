The riff master is back!<br />  </li> <li>Out Of Exile - Seriously funky and an awesome solo.</li><li>Be Youself - Heard before and can already play it, great tune. Got to love the whammy.<br /> </li><li>Doesn't Remind Me - Starts slow but not long till they get to a drool inducing solo.</li><li>Drown Me Slowly - Faster pacing and more screachy than normal (good thing), awesome bass at the two minute mark.</li>   <li>Heavens Dead - Very melodic but still a nice crunchy guitar.<br /> </li><li>The Worm - Very Zeppelin esque verses.<br />   </li>   <li>Man Or Animal - Great drum rolls, scratch tastic and a crazy ass solo.<br />   </li>   <li>Yesterday to Tomorrow - Good<br />   </li>   <li>Dandelion - Slower song with great bridge<br />   </li>   <li>Number 1 Zero - Slowing it down even more building up to some cool metal.<br />   </li>   <li>The Curse - Soundgarden-ish chords. Good lyrically.<br /> </li>    </ol>This is an improvement on the last album for one clear reason. Last time it sounded like Morrello was a bit restricted compared to his Rage days but this time arround he goes off into crazy solos with pleanty of whammy and there are some dead funky riffs in there. This also has the trademark Audioslave slower songs still in the right ammount - as much as some of us would like they are not trying to be Rage. Overall it starts off hard and funky slows down towards the end, I'm buying this one.<br />
