> Finally, the studio is asking that Epic be forced to surrender all profits garnered by Gears of War as a result of misconduct.
And the reason,

> "That advantage was nowhere more evident than at E3 2006, where Gears of War was awarded 'Best Game in Show' and garnered nothing but laudatory press," the suit reads. "By contrast, Silicon Knights--one of the only other developers to publicly display a playable demonstration of its game--saw Too Human roundly criticized in the videogame press for its technical problems and generally unpolished appearance. The damage to Silicon Knights caused by Epic's misconduct was manifest, because E3 attendees were able to compare Too Human with another game running ostensibly the same game engine, Gears of War, with vastly superior results."

So it all comes back to E3 2006 <em>again</em>. First they <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3158015">blamed the press</a> now they blame the engine. I seem to remember another Unreal Engine 3 game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine_3#Unreal_Engine_3_2">Rainbow Six: Vegas</a> coming out in late 2006 and being very successful. Funny that.

This game has been in and out of development for 8 years. Something tells me they have bigger issues internally than they care to admit.
