title: Delusional Students &#038; a Misguided Government

Recently myself and several hundred other students at Aston University recieved an email from a disillusioned student within our department (full message <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/downloads/petition.txt">here</a>). In it he moans about the Computing for Business course he is currently taking and produces this alarming comment early on,
<blockquote>Unlike other degrees we do not have any easy modules which take our overall average higher. This is unfair as our effort is not reflected in our overall degree result. Most major organisations do not care what degree a graduate has got as long as it is a high 2:1. So why do we have to work so hard and get a low average?</blockquote>
So he wants easy modules and doesn't want to work very hard to get them, not only that but further on in the e-mail he states that he will be starting a petition today to get things changed.

This is the kind of student that is being bred in the UK right now.

With our current Labour government more and more people are being encouraged to go into further education to study whatever they like. Which is great, a more educated Britain will be a more prosperous Britain, but it's the type of further education being provided and the illusions being fed to our generation that are at fault.

The main problem is the government wants <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4093089.stm">50% of people</a> to go to university, which is plainly wrong. University courses will have to be dumbed down so they can actually get some graduates, no doubt many have been already, but not as much as my ill-prepared co-student would like.

Rather than dumbing down and devaluing the degrees we are trying to earn the government should be concentrating on getting more people into a wider range of further education. Whether it's apprenticeships, industrial placements or alternative training courses it would be a far more realistic prospect and give people meaningful skills instead of meaningless degrees for subjects they have no love for.

I am not being a snob and am far from the perfect student but I do have the passion and ability to get the most from my degree. People shouldn't be deluded that they can become a lawyer or a doctor when they do not have the requisite ability to do so.

I am not saying aim low, just aim realistically.
