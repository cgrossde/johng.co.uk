Why did Microsoft go and shoot themselves in the foot? Everything was going swimmingly for the launch of their new console and now they have gone and botched it by announcing **two** <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/2005/08/17/xbox_360_uk_price.html">different models</a>. The main limiting and game affecting difference between the two is, one has a hard drive and the other doesn't.

I can think of so many reasons why this is wrong for publishers, developers and most importantly of all, us, the consumers.

This is a step back. Every single Xbox out there has a hard drive built in, the next generation should seek to build on that not climb down from it. It leaves developers in a state of limbo over whether to use the hard drive knowing the majority of their users (I will explain this later) probablly won't have one. The publishers certainly won't push for features that only a section of their market can access and will never give the go ahead to unique, interesting and diverse uses of the hard drive.

I think the majority of people will go for the cheaper model after my experience working  at GAME for many years. I can see it now, mother walks in to buy her kid a console, sees two models, asks the assistant what the difference is and realises there is no tangible difference so she goes for the cheap one.

And that's the key here. It isn't a **tangible** difference because average Joe Schmoe on the street doesn't think he needs a hard drive, even if he does, he doesn't know any better, and why should he? So if no one buys them then the developers will not develop for them.

This isn't PC land, this is consoles, where multi teared requirements don't work and instead create a visicious circle of consumers not buying and developers not developing.
