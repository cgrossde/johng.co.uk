These are my Top 5 games on <em>any</em> platform this year. Being a transition year between console generations has been tougher than I expected on the release cycle. Early 2006 and summer 2006 were particularly sparse for releases, leading to a high number of titles launching in the Christmas season.

On a personal note 2006 was a year where I played very little between the months of January and May. Finishing up that degree seems so long ago but it involved going cold turkey for several months to get it done. With new releases on the level I mentioned this resulted in only needing to catch up on a small number of titles luckily enough.

This list is composed of games released in 2006 which <em>I</em> played, so anything which I didn't spend time with is not included. I don't see this as a problem as games which I don't choose to play wouldn't have made this by their very nature anyway. Argue all you like by the lack of Zelda Twilight Princess but it simply didn't move the genre forward and ultimately was the reason for me not getting a Wii.

The two games perched far and away at the top of this list <em>did</em> move their respective genres forward. Both Gears of War and Oblivion are huge technical and creative achievements that have set the bar obscenely high for what games can do. If you play any two games this year it must be these.
