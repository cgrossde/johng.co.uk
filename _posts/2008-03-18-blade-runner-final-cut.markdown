I've had some time this week to check out the 5 disc edition of [Blade Runner: Final Cut](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000ZP20M6?tag=johngblog-21). It's worthy of mention here as it's packed with more high quality special features than I have ever seen in a DVD before. Every conceivable version of the movie is here, the documentary Dangerous Days is outstanding and the features disc goes into even more detail. The "Final Cut" of the movie is fantastic and feels like the Blade Runner that Scott had always intended to make.

I thought Lord of the Rings had milked as much as possible with their 4 disc release per film but this just blows that away.
