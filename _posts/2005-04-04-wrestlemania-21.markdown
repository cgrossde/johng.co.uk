Stayed up last night for Wrestlemania, I have to see this PPV live, it's tradition ;-). Best match was Angle vs HBK and I am very pleased Angle won that as he seems to keep losing matches at Wrestlemania. The crowd were really into it and there seemed to be more Angle fans than HBK fans in the audience.

Orton vs Taker was good. So that means Orton managed to get a good match out of Taker and it was probablly Taker's best match since WM17 against Triple H. Some good moments such as when Orton countered the choke slam into the RKO and I also liked the end of this match, Orton went for a tombstone and then Taker converted it into another tombstone and finshed it.

Cena vs JBL was a chore to watch and the crowd didn't care for it either. After such a long title reign for JBL you'd think people would be more pleased to see Cena win but after he got the pin fall it was pretty dead. They should have saved the change for the next Smackdown PPV so it actually means something.

The Batista vs Triple H match was surprisingly good and they did a great spot where Big Dave forced his way out of the Pedigree and converted it into some sort of side slam. Dave went over after power bomb and got a proper reaction this time.

Looks like Edge will be Batista's first opponent as he won the ladder match. As for Cena I have no idea where they are going with him, I guess he could face Angle but then who else is there? They  really need to do a draft to freshen up the rosters, no doubt this will be announced on RAW tonight.
