Looks like Birmingham city centre has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4668313.stm">evacuated</a> tonight in response to a bomb threat. Man this sucks. The area evacuated includes where my new flat is which I actually start paying rent on today. Good job I didn't go and get the keys this weekend.
