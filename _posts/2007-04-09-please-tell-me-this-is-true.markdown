From <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0408-im.htm">Xbox.com</a> about the spring update,
*	Added H.264 video support: Up to 10 Mbps peak, Baseline, Main, and High profiles with 2 channel AAC LC.</li>
*	Added MPEG-4 Part 2 video support: Up to 5 Mbps peak, Simple Profile with 2 channel AAC LC.</li>

Potential for x264 and Xvid compatibility me thinks! Hells yes!
