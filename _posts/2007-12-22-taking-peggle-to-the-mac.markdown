I have been playing far too much <a href="http://www.popcap.com/games/peggle">Peggle</a> recently (as evidenced by my <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/johno">Steam account</a> - can't hide anything these days) and was a bit worried I wouldn't be able to take my obsession on the road with me due to my recent Mac defection. Low and behold in a feat of amazing timing <a href="http://www.popcap.com/">Popcap</a> go and release <a href="http://www.popcap.com/games/mac/peggle">Peggle for Mac OSX</a>! Best of all the save files are fully compatible.

If you are like me and need to move your saves over just go into the Steam apps folder and locate the Peggle userdata directory. Its then just a matter of copying the contents over to /Users/Username/Library/Application Support/PopCap/Peggle/userdata and you are set to continue the grand master challenge.
