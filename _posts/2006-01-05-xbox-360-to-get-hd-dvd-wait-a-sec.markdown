Wasn't the console just released? Greg Howson <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/2006/01/05/external_hddvd.html">nails it</a> for many people reading the <a href="http://xbox360.joystiq.com/2006/01/04/gates-external-hd-dvd-drive-for-xbox-360/">anouncement made at CES</a>, but it means more than just an extra box in the living room. It means that once again, counting the hard drive as the first incident, that the 360 platform has been broken by adding an extra dimension that isn't needed.

Sure Peter 'Dreamcast' Moore didn't mention if games would be affected or not and merely stated that it was for playback of movies, but I am sure many developers are quaking in their boots at the prospects of another non-standard component added to the puzzle.

It's a nice way to push the HD-DVD format and stick it to Sony once again but I'd like to see the movies on the shelves and a commitment to <em>games </em>developers made before this thing sees the light of day.
