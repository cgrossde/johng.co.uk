Almost saw three cyclists get run over on my way to work today. Don't get me wrong, cycling is great and we'd all be much better off doing it for our health, our wallets and the environment but some of these guys just look like they're trying to get run over. The combined bus and cycle lanes they have along the South bank just mean the cyclists hit buses and taxis instead of cars for a short part of their journey. If the mayor want more bums on saddles (bikes not horses, there's enough crap in the road already) then he is going to have to do much more to ensure the safety of people who choose pedal power over petrol power.
