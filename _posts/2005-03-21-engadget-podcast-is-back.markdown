I was very surprised to see the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000970036858/">Engadget podcast pop up</a> in my aggregator today! After about three months off they are back with a new host and (hopefully) more regular releases. I had deleted this feed from Doppler after nothing came through for two months and realising Phil Tyrone (original host) had moved to <a href="http://make.oreilly.com/blog/">MAKE magazine</a> but looks like there is life in the old dog yet.
