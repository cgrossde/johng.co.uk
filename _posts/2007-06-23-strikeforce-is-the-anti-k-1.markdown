Two large MMA shows happened this month with a lot of similarities. Both were in California, both were co-promoted with EliteXC and both were going up against free Zuffa cards on the same weekend. Last night at the HP Pavilion in San Jose Strikeforce completely schooled K-1 at promoting in California and put on one hell of a show. Not only did the much hyped main event deliver in spades but top to bottom the card was stacked with exciting fights. Cung Lee, Murilo Ninja, Josh Thompson and Paul Buentello all came out to entertain and win their fights in impressive fashion.

Somehow I feel EliteXC will be partnering with Strikeforce again and avoiding the horrendous mess that is K-1. The biggest drawing fight in that town without question would be Frank Shamrock vs Cung Lee and boy do I want to see that match after tonight. Watch this show now!
