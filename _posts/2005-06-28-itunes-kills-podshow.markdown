Looks like the podshow network has been the <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/06/28">hardest hit</a> of all after today's release of iTunes 4.9. At the time of writing I cannot download any of their shows or gain access to their sites. On Saturday <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/06/25">Adam talked</a> about Bit Torrent being the future for distributing the shows as the number of subscribers increases to new heights. This latest outage makes it even more apparent we have a long way to go as I can't see Apple adding Bit Torrent support in a hurry.
