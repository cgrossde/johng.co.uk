That bright orange blob actually sucks things towards it in a manner resembling gravity. All depends on the mass, the distance, etc. And yes I did have to break out my A-Level Physics text book to figure out how to do this - too many formulas. <strike>So if you have the XNA Game Studio Express Beta 2 then <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/downloads/XNAGravityDemo.zip">check it out</a>. If not then wait till whenever the redistributable libraries come out (don't ask).</strike> <span style="font-weight: bold">UPDATE: </span>Actually it turns out there is a redistributable XNA framework out so anyone can try it! New download is <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/downloads/XNAGravityDemo.zip">here</a> with the XNA stuff included.

It's very basic, you can't do much but it shows what you can achieve after a few days.
