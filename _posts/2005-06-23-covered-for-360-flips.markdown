I have actually already gone for the <a href="http://new.egg.com/visitor/0,,3_22015--View_422,00.html">¬£15 Egg travel insurance</a> specifically because it covers <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/msclark/60162.html">winter sports</a>. That's darn cheap considering you can throw yourself off a mountain strapped to a plank (or two) every morning for 17 days and still be covered.
