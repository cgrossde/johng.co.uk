Well that was a crappy show. What more can be said. Tito vs Ken needed to be stopped as Shamrock wasn't doing a damn thing to defend himself. Sylvia vs Arlovski was two guys who probablly respect each other too much now and really Arlovski didn't do enough to win the title.

The one promising thing that did come out of the show was the potential of Liddell vs Silva if Chuck can get through Babalu next. Amazing dream match stuff it is but it brings up more questions than answers about Silva's status with the UFC. FightOpinion has <a href="http://www.fightopinion.com/2006/07/09/ufc-vs-pride-2/">the best article</a> on it I have seen.
