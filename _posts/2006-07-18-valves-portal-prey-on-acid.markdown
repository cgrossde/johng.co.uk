It takes the idea of portals used well in Prey and takes them to a whole new level allowing you to totally manipulate them using some kind of portal gun. It appears you shoot entry and exit points onto walls and then those points are spatially linked in the world.

Of course this leads to some extremely mad results such as falling forever (portal on floor and ceiling) and the ability to suck objects in and make them appear out of anywhere, on enemies if needst be.

It looks like a hell of a lot of fun and I do like the way Valve seem to be building on the gravity gun and building more physics orientated gameplay. Lets face it Source is awesome for physics, one look at <a href="http://www.garrysmod.com/">Gary's mod</a> show us that. Portal looks like it can deliver whacky gameplay by the bucketload.
