title: A Public Service Health Warning

If you or anyone you know is studying for exams or producing coursework I strongly advise against the purchase of Civilization 4. This sickly addictive game will turn Sunday afternoons into early Monday mornings in the blink of an eye. It is, quite simply, virtual crack. Steer clear at all costs.

Then again if you are not in a position where you should be doing something better with your time - indulge!

<em>This public service health warning was paid for by the friends and supporters of recovering Civ addict John Griffin.</em>
