I couldn't help but laugh as soon as I saw <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1448994,00.html">this story</a>. Thats right Christopher Eccleston is no longer the Doctor. Hang on a minute, how many episodes of the new season have been on TV? And he is already quiting? If he didn't want to be typecast he should have never accepted the role and as the 'grueling schedule' it's clear he just doesn't want to work in Wales.

Excuse me while I go and laugh hysterically in a corner somewhere.
