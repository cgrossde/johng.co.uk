You can chalk up the lower than normal posts here to the latest incarnation of GTA winding up on my hard drive. A massive huge game that gives you a sense of freedom none of it's rivals can replicate. When you leave your home city for the first time and travel down the long winding highways through the countryside you know that it's something special. And while all this is happening you don't see a single loading screen as Rockstar have come up with some incredible way of streaming the rolling terrain into memory without ever needing to pause. It's amazing what they have been able to accomplish with this archaic engine.

Unfortunately it does feel a little rough around the edges as the port from the PS2 didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. Graphical glitches are pretty prolific and it doesn't make anywhere near enough use of the hardware that's available to it like modern PC games should. Thankfully these technical quibbles do not overcome or engulf the experience and the pure game play and attention to detail shine through.

It tells you a lot about the quality and originality of a game when it has suffered badly from a conversion but can still be considered the best game of 2005. Back to the streets of San Fierro I go.
