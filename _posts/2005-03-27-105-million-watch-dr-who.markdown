Well their viral marketing campain worked as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4385801.stm">10.5 million people tunned into Dr Who last night</a>. It's not as big a deal as they make it out to be that they beat Ant and Dec as it's hardly the pinacle of comedy and entertainment. Why they seek to beat ITV's low brow trash in the ratings is beyond me as they appeal to completely different audiences.
