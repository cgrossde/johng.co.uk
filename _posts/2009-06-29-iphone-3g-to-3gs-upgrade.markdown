title: iPhone 3G to 3GS Upgrade

I took the plunge and treated myself to a brand spanking new iPhone 3GS this weekend. After much dilly dallying I decided to upgrade from the iPhone 3G because <a href="http://www.cashinmyfone.com/">cashinmyfone</a> were offering good rates for trade ins that could cover the cost of buying out my contract. Getting the handset proved to be a bit of mission.

After finally tracking one down at the Apple store in Westfields I had to spend 75 minutes in there going through everything. O2 were not very helpful and were trying to stop the buyout from happening in the Apple store. Of course Apple have been doing contract buyouts for a while, it just depends if the call centre worker they call to verify it knows that.

But I have it and I'm happy. It's fast as hell, it has a compass and the camera is significantly better (there are hundreds of reviews online if you need to know). Oh and now I'm inline with the yearly release cycle the upgrade hit won't be to bad next year.
