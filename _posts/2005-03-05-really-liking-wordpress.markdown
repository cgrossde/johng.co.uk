Gotta say <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> rocks. Its really flexible and it was worth getting the MySQL database up just so I could run it. The php is easy to understand and I was quickly able to start modifying the default theme and start adding bits to it. I now have the sidebar on every page and I added thumbnails to my latest photos on flickr.

I just started using flickr yesterday as a photo upload service and so far I am very impressed, its not really designed for storing all your photos but more for a select few that can be easily shared through <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/rotherhithe/">tags</a>, <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/?p=4">blogs</a> or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/profile_mailconf.gne">whatever</a>. At the moment there are a few snaps from my mobile (<a href="http://www.motorola.com/mdirect/hellomoto/experience/v3/flash/default.shtml">Motorola V3</a>) and from some friend's cameras - its not hard to tell which came from a proper digital camera. I had been looking at the Pentax Optio cameras as I am after a small pocket sized device and the S5i is at a very <a href="http://www.novatech.co.uk/NOVATECH/specpage.html?PEN-OPTS5I">good price on Novatech</a> right now. Both <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2004_reviews/optios5i.html">Steve's Digicams</a> and <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentaxs5i/">DPReview</a> highly recommend it which makes it all the more tempting.
