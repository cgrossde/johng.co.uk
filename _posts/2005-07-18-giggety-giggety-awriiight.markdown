I wasn't going to talk about it but Family Guy was far too good this week not to. Chris in the video for "Take on Me" by A-Ha just blew my mind, the Goonies in the sewers, Peter in the Neverending story(!), Quagmire's theme song and loads more made it so darn good. This thing was just crammed so full of jokes it was splitting at the seams and so was I. Definately the highlight of the season so far for me.
