title: New Application in Development

I have been spending some time recently working on a project that has been bouncing around my head now for a few years now. It's a very focused application in terms of what it achieves with the main aim being usability. It's written in .NET 3.0 making it my first foray into the world of C# and WPF. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a> is the key reason this project is even happening at all. It's seriously giving me unmatched flexibility when it comes to UI design, allowing concepts that appear complex in other applications to become very clear if presented well.

No planned release date yet but I am writing this post because this time I'm confident of completion unlike previous attempts on the idea. If you're interested in testing at the alpha stage please drop me an <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/contact/">email</a> or leave a comment. More details soon.
