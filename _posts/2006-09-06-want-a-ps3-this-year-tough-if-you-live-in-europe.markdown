Early this morning brought about the <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=67341">colossal announcement</a> from Sony that the PS3 wouldn't be hitting Europe untill March 07. Many people claimed to have seen this coming due to the lack of PS3s actually being manufactured but even they must be shocked by this amazing blunder.

By all accounts this should allow Microsoft and Nintendo to clean up this Christmas giving them a serious lead on their much delayed rival. The console business was always going to be a tough nut for Microsoft to crack but Sony apear to be doing everything in their power to give them a huge piece of the pie, all on a silver platter at that.

Looking further into today's news and it looks like this won't only affect Europe. Japan and the US will only be getting <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/06/north-american-japanese-ps3-launch-limited-to-500-000-units/">100,000 and 400,000</a> units respectively, much less than the 2 million vaunted by Sony.

And why oh why are Sony floundering so badly right now?

Blu-ray.

If they hadn't bet the company on their new format all the consoles and more would have been ready for launch. Infact they could have launched earlier in the year. Better than that it would have cost half as much!
Is it really worth risking it all on a new media format?

No, but they think it is.
And in an era of broadband and high capacity hard drives no one but Sony understands why.
