Andy has a good write up on LocateTV <a href="http://www.gambituk.com/2007/08/02/locatetv-a-revolution-in-online-tv-searching/">here</a>, surprisingly relevant as I attempt to use the BBC iPlayer. I couldn't make it to the event but pretty much all you need to know is in that write up.

So I have got to ask, where's my beta key Lottie\Andy?
