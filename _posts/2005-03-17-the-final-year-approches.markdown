Last night I spoke to some good friends from my first year at uni, strange that we were all contacting each other on the same day after months without a peep. Probably the unrealistic urgency that accommodation hunting brings to us when looking for somewhere to live such a long time away in October. I still have a while to go here in London and so do they (wherever they are) but I think one thing we all agree on is that we want to go back to uni asap, its just a totally different lifestyle, one that I am missing right now. Everyone seems to be going back on campus (or near enough) after a second year mass exodus which is great as I really dig the sense of community you get on a tight nit campus like ours. I get so much more work done when I am surrounded by similar minded, motivated people and have a more fun and enjoyable down time as a result. Bring on the final year.
