I never want to deal with letting agents again. Their websites suck, they don't answer the phones and they never call back. My theory is they are making so much money hand over fist that it's actually a waste of their time to pursuing clients as one walks through the door every few minutes with a wad of cash in hand. Unfortunately it's getting harder and harder to deal directly with landlords now that the agencies have polluted all the decent listing sites. Gap in the market? I'll look into it.

Long story short I found somewhere half decent and fingers crossed I can move in this week (or at least whenever the broadband gets hooked up). The old BT monopoly reared its head once again and wanted to charge a ¬£125 connection fee for the phone line! But thanks to <a href="http://www.gambituk.com/2007/09/26/back-on-the-net/">Andy</a>'s Bulldog suggestion I will be paying a grand total of ¬£1! Lets just hope they show up for the installation. One of my considerations in picking a flat this time aside from location and price has been <em>large white walls</em>. You know the kind a projector would look good on? More on that when I have it set up.

It's looking pretty hectic this week and I will be travelling about quite a bit so I look forward to my next post coming from the new place (if everything goes according to plan)!
