I have been writing a 'diary' while on placement using Live Journal. Reason being that I needed a quick, easy and free way of posting entries which LJ pretty much fulfills. I am approaching the time when I will need to consolidate all these entries into something presentable so I have a few things I could do.

1) Give the person reviewing my diary access to my private entries, trouble is the need an LJ account.

2) Convert the LJ into PDF. It can be done! I found <a href="http://www.ljbook.com/">this cool tool</a> that takes the XML and produces an acrobat document. Looks pretty useful and the output doesn't seem to shabby.

3) Port the LJ to Wordpress and do something with it later. I figure that if I can get the LJ entries into this wordpress blog using the built in import tool I can just extract them from the mySQL database and format them how I see fit.

I will probably do number 3 because I can stick the resulting posts into OpenOffice and format them how I see fit. Its very welcome that Wordpress make it so easy to port you old blogs over.

Oh and no it won't be public if I do convert it onto this blog. What with all the company secrets and scandalous stories about colleagues it could never be published on the web. I do have some integrity ;-)
