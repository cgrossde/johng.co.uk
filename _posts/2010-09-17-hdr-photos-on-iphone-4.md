title: "HDR Photos on iPhone 4"
---
The recent [iOS 4.1 update](http://www.apple.com/iphone/software-update/) added the ability to take HDR photos from the iPhone 4 camera app. Last weekend in London we had the [Thames Festival](http://www.thamesfestival.org/) which made for a great opportunity to try out the new feature in a low light setting. Here are some of the photos below. You can see the iPhone stores both the regular version (left) and the HDR enhanced one (right).

The rest of the set is up on flickr [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgriffin/sets/72157624977375288/). It still doesn't come close to a real camera. Even a cheap point a shoot would avoid this level of blurring and light streaks. In daylight the camera is great but anything else is a gamble.
