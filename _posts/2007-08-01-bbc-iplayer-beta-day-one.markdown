Here we go with day one of my BBC iPlayer on going live blog converage.

I fired up my browser went to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">iPlayer homepage</a> and entered my username and password. Main page loads with a nice pink and black design - cool. Great lets download a show, bit of Doctor Who I'm thinking but there's only 6 days remaining on this episode. DRM slap in the face. I click on DOWNLOAD and get a message about my browser, oh no I am in Firefox, my default browser and choice of millions of people around the world. Couldn't possibly be supported by this site.

I reload in IE and get back to same point. I click on DOWNLOAD again. What's that red X now!? Oh damn I am in Vista! Ugh. Forget it I'll carry on tomorrow.
