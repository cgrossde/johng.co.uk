I have been running this blog for several years now and it was starting to show. In short upgrade after upgrade to wordpress had built up a ton of bloat making it fairly unusable for me and eventually led to the RSS feeds braking. To this end I have spent the last 2 days rebuilding the site from scratch and feel I have now reached the state of the existing site. Please let me know if there are any problems.<br /><br />PS Wordpress limit XML imports to 7mb. Mine was 15mb. Now imagine how fun it is to trim a 15mb XML file - not good.<br />
