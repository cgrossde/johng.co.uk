<p>I got my new <a target="_self" href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/05/09/new-dvd-burner/">DVD burner</a> yesterday and so far its been very fast and produced very good quality recordings. One of the reasons I got it was to fix my Xbox, unfortunately in trying to do so last night I did the worst thing you can do and accidentally flashed a Microsoft bios thus restoring it to it's original state and locking me out completely. So now I have to do either a hardware or software mod to get it back. Not going to go hardware - it just takes way too long. Instead I'll pick up a copy of Splinter Cell off ebay and using a hacked memory stick do the soft mod to get it back to a usable state.</p><p>I really messed my xbox up big time.</p>
