Futurama will be returning in a straight to video movie <a href="http://dvd.ign.com/articles/634/634262p1.html">according to Billy West</a>. Look forward to copious amounts of Slurm drinking and more fun with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_Bending_Rodriguez">Bender Bending Rodriguez</a>. The popularity of the DVD medium is really pumping new life into these shows and I love it.

Morbo says, "Punny Earthlings get their cartoon back and it shall brainwash their stupid human minds again!".
