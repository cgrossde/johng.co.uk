<div align="left">Press release <a href="http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=3959">here</a>. WFA wasn't a threat, they were going out of business and it seems this was the best way to secure some of the contracts UFC had been seeking. <a href="http://www.thefightnetwork.com/news_detail.php?nid=2832">Rampage is a cert</a> and <a href="http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=18123">they want Lindland</a> so he can't be far behind. Herring and a few others are possibilities but right now only Jackson is confirmed.</div>
This is great news for 2007, Tito and Chuck are going to have a few more guys looking for piece of the LHW title pie. More importantly we will have some FRESH MATCHES.

Now they just need to get Cro-Cop and this will be a dream week of UFC purchases.
