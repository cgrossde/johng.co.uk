Seems like the current Dr Who <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=0&id=30784">never quit the show</a> because he only ever agreed to do one season in the first place. The BBC panicked when the word got out a few weeks ago and confirmed he had left the show leading to todays apology to the actor. The shambles continues.
