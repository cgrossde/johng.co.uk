The 90 minute season finale of BSG was everything we could have hoped for and more. I have never seen a show jump a year ahead and then continue the story line without batting an eye lid. Many shows such as Star Trek would jump about in the timeline but that was for one off episodes and they'd be right back in the present the next week.

It's a testament to the quality of the writing and the characters that we have seen develop over the past few years that Ron Moore was able to accomplish  such a feat successfully. Everything was in place, Baltar's colonisation plans were doomed to fail and all the character's relationships were in lined up and holding firm.

It certainly has huge implications for the next season which may or may not wind up on NBC proper in October. It's going to be a totally different show and I can see it having more of a secret rebelious feel to it rather than the huge space battles we are used to. There's only a skeleton crew manning the fleet so it will be a while before we see that sort of thing again.

As for the potential move to NBC there are arguements for and against. On the plus side more people are going to see the show and with NBC comes HD, rather than the god awful quality that is being used in the first runs at the moment. On the flip side the season is going to start much later and there will be more ratings pressure making it more likely to fail and get canceled on that network.

Personally I believe it should be moved to NBC as the iTunes downloads and DVD sales can more than make up for any lost revenue from ratings. The gains of HD and an increase in the budget would allow the already epic series to ascend to new heights.

Roll on October.
