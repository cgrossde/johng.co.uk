I checked [this TED video]({{page.url}}) out a few weeks ago but forgot to post it up. Looks like MS are really trying to give Google a run for their money in the mapping space. Live video and cloud sourced images (using the photosynth tech we saw a few years back) overlaid onto street view!

They must be collecting 3D data here too as the buildings appear to be made up of images overlaid on 3D models. Radar? Image processing? Who knows, it's very clever though. When can I get this on my iPhone :) ?
