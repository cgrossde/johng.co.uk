I think Andy raises some <a href="http://gambit.wordpress.com/2006/01/04/pride-shockwave/">interesting points</a> about Pride in comparison to UFC. I agree that UFC build their fights up better than Pride do on the show itself but if you read the MMA news and know the history of the fighters involved it can be just as interesting.

UFC overall is a far better product with entertaining pre-match builds and slicker presentation and feel of the entire show. This is because it's live, most of the fighters speak English and there isn't the huge culture gap that any Japanese production brings.

Pride do have a far better heavyweight divison with Fedor, Crocop and Hunt but UFC out classes them with welterweights such as Hughes, Penn and St.Pierre. And you know with UFC that the refereeing and judging of fights is way more down the middle than Pride where you can't help feeling some of the officials are watching different fights.

The Ultimate Fighter has also helped to get the personalities of the fighters accross which they had always struggled to do before. To say my hopes are high for the Shamrock and Ortiz fued in season three would be a huge understatement.

So UFC is easily the best overall but for the MMA addicts who  need more and maybe want to see better heavyweights Pride is an occasional entertaining diversion.
