This is much harder to pick than the top PCs games as there is an awful lot of good TV out there. But purely based on how much I have enjoyed them here are my picks.

<strong>Best New Show:</strong>

Prison Break

<strong>Runners Up:</strong>

24, Lost, Top Gear, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Doctor Who, Family Guy, Rome

<strong>Winner:</strong>

Battlestar Galactica

Galactica may have a small fraction of the budget of Lost but it's plot, characters and action are on another level. Ron Moore's writing and attention to detail shine through above everything else making it not only a great TV show but a genre defining one.
