Check out these numbers (via <a href="http://www.f4wonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2481&Itemid=1">F4WOnline</a>),
- Fight did a 9.7 rating in males 25-34
- Fight did an 8.0 rating in males 18-34
- Show drew 4.2 million viewers overall, crushing Smackdown's CW debut
- Fight did 5.7 million viewers, more than watched Raw or Smackdown last week
- Show drew more 18-34 men than any show on broadcast OR cable all day
- Highest rating for a night in males 18-34 and 18-49 in Spike history
- Broke the spike.tv website one-day unique viewers record
- Broke the old UFC quarter hour viewership record by 2 million viewers

Excellent stuff. I'm glad so many people got to see this rivalry come to an end in such a classy way. You heard the loud cheers for the Tito vs Chuck match in December when it was mentioned and following on from this I predict it should do the biggest buy rate in UFC history.
