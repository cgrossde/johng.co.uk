Saw Revolver last night after much debate on Skype as to the existance and non-existance of the cinemas in Birmingham. It seems like every week a cinema is getting rebranded, bought, moved or built and it has everyone rather confused. We settled for the new AMC in the end, which I have never been to and didn't even know existed. Nice place, good prices and a large screen - great.

As for the movie, that's still in the air. Guy Richie's latest left us with some interesting ideas and pleanty to ponder but I couldn't help feeling he tried way too hard. Cool movies that blow you mind are great such as Donnie Darko, Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Here Richie tries so hard to disguise the twist that film becomes overlly complicated when in the grand scheme of things it needn't be.

Visually the film is impressive with every camera angle meticulously poised and with a depth that is missing from many movies. Unfortunately at one point in the film, and for no reason, some kind of terrible cell shaded computer animation is used that feels horribly out of place and rubs off as poor man's Kill Bill. Tarantino he is not.

If you enjoy long, mind bending movies with strong characters then there is a lot to enjoy here. If you want entertaining, non-headache inducing film that doesn't insult your intelligence then this isn't for you.
