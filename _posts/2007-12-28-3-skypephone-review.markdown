<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgriffin/2054705629/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2388/2054705629_7b89bb32ff_m.jpg" alt="3 Skypephone" align="right" border="0" height="240" width="180" /></a> I had always found it frustrating to get a good Skype setup going in Windows. Either the speakers were too loud and caused an echo, the cheap handset was falling apart or Windows had forgotten the audio device I was using. So getting a handset that just worked well with the Skype network was very refreshing but getting one that I could use anywhere was even better.

The <a href="http://www.3skypephone.com/">3 Skypephone</a> is on the surface a standard handset with an average camera, ok screen and fairly decent build quality. But it comes into its own when using the unique Skype software on the device in conjunction with the 3 mobile network. Aside from video calling the mobile client is almost identical to its PC counterpart giving the ability to make and receive calls on the Skype network, manage contacts and even use the instant messaging function.

One of my concerns was how it would manage being logged in on the PC and the mobile simultaneously if at all. Luckily it works just fine with both the phone and PC ringing out when receiving calls and any messages received appearing on both.

Calls are clear to, from and between Skype/mobiles with no noticeable lag. The keypad is solid and the screen is big enough to make texting and IM pretty easy. The only catch I can see so far is that if you wanted to purchase a pay as you go handset just for Skype use it needs to be kept topped up. This is because any credit you purchase will eventually expire and having credit on the phone is a requirement of using the Skype features. Alternatively you can just go for a contract and you're set.

It's not replacing my <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/k850i">SE k850i</a> as a camera phone but it's hardly fair to compare the two. As a solid second handset or¬† a dedicated Skype phone it's almost perfect and for £50 or £90 for a pair it's a rather attractive deal.
