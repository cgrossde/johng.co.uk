<p>Now <a target="_self" href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/input/sunbeam-20in1-front-panel-reviewed-verdict-excellent-100431.php">this is</a> what I call a <em>real</em> front panel connector. 20 in 1, including highlights such as SATA (wtf?) and an RCA connection along with the obligitory USB and firewire ports. This is what I don't get though. Lets say I decide to hook up a SATA hard drive using this thing, where is the power coming from? I still have to run a power lead from my PSU to the drive, thus defeating the point of the front panel.</p><p>Very tempting none the less as I have been looking for away to plug in my guitar and headphones without having to reach around the back of my system constantly. Not a bad price either.<br /> </p>
