I am writing this on the train on the way back from home, it's been a great few days so thanks to everyone who made it really special. Shame I couldn't stay longer but I need to keep my annual leave for use at the end of my contract, it will be better in the long run.

Got the new camera I <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/03/05/really-liking-wordpress/">mentioned before</a> for my birthday and man it's tiny! Fits in my pocket nicely so I can just carry it with me and not worry about it, just what I wanted. My parents got it from pixmania.com so it came with French manuals and power cable, strange that it doesn't mention that on the site when you buy it but that didn't really matter as I found the manual on the CD and have pleanty of suitable power cables lying around.

Over the last few days I have run into a new problem with my Motorola V3. Thinking that my dad would have a mini usb cable at home which I could use for charging I didn't take one with me. He did have one, but my phone was so underpowed when I came to charge it, it wouldn't turn on. I didn't realise that it needed to be switched on to charge via USB so I have been pretty much phoneless for most of this week. I am sure when I get in and charge it up with my mains adapter I will have a stack of missed calls and texts to followup on, so sorry if you have been trying to reach me.

They really need to fit wifi into these trains as I can only get a connection when we pull into a station. If this has appeared on the site it's been posted when we pulled into High Wycombe.
