I was just alerted by the <a href="http://www.mtavc.com/blog/index.php?mode=viewid&amp;post_id=86">development blog</a> that the release of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas multiplayer is iminent and a <a href="http://light.mtavc.com/">count down timer</a> has been put up on their site.

By the time everyone reads this the full release will probablly be out. This is something I have been waiting ages for and I'm glad the mod team feel they have a stable enough build they can now release for public consumption. From just watching the videos they have released over the last few months you can see they have added a ton of new features to make multiplayer even better.

Fingers crossed we can get it to work here given my current Internet conncection status (shared line on campus with no host to host traffic).

See you in Los Santos!
