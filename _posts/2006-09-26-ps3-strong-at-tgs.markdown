[This week's 1-UP show](http://media.1up.com/flat/News/Videos/3153999_broad.html) has the most credible and positive discussion I have seen/heard/read on the PS3 yet. Aside from the lackluster keynote this is probablly the best week SCE have had in a long time and they certainly proved they have no intentions of losing the Japanese market just yet. As for the West, that's shaping up to be a completely different battleground.
