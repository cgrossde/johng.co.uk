Between heavy multiplayer sessions of Rainbow Six Vegas you can't help but notice the sheer amount of noise produced by the Xbox 360. Which is why I am stunned that it has been <a href="http://www.pregamelobby.com/forum/view_console_loudness.htm">proven to be the quietest</a> when playing a disk based game out of all three 'next gen' (or is that current gen) systems. I was positive that Nintendo or Sony wouldn't go any louder but it would seem I was wrong. Perhaps it has something to do with the slot loading and blu-ray drives they use.

It would seem in an effort to reduce load times all the modern consoles have been given the fastest drives possible with no consideration for the noise they produce. The best recommendation for 360, Wii and PS3 owners? Just play Lumies Live, Bomberman '93 and Gran Turismo HD - no disk thrashing involved!
