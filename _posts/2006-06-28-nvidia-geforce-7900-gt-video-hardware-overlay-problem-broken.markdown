<strong>UPDATE (6/7/06@2:10am)</strong>

Holy crap I finally fixed it! If you are having this issue on the Extreme Edition XFX cards or any other manufacturer OC'd card just underclock it to 450Mhz on the core and 600Mhz on the memory. If you can't see the frequency settings in your control panel you need to download the <a href="http://www.overclockers.com.au/techstuff/a_coolbits/">CoolBits</a> registry hack to make it appear. I literally just got this working so I need to tweak it some more but it seems to be an issue that can be fixed by future driver updates. So until the next version comes out we will have to run with slower cores.

I'm just so damn happy I don't have to RMA right now :-).

<strong>END OF UPDATE</strong>

Been a bit busy as of late working (Java part time) and building PCs. Got all my components together over the weeknd and had a whale of a time trying to get it to work. Suffice to say, 2 power supplies later and trying every different RAM combination under the sun and it now works. For the record if your getting random hard resets it's either you power supply or in my case the RAM isn't in the right slots. It just so happens on this motherboard the first two slots were screwed but the second were fine. Shame it took me two days to figure that out - natch.

I am very happy with the system apart from one issue which is driving me nuts. For some bizzare reason I cannot for the life of me get hardware overlay on my graphics card to work. I am running a GeForce 7900 GT with the AM2 4000 X2 chip on an Asus M2N32 mobo.

I am using the latest <a href="http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/winxp_2k_91.31_uk.html">91.31 ForceWare drivers</a> and have even reninstalled Windows from scratch a few times to see if I had installed something which broke it and as it turns out I did not. So right now all videos are playing back under software mode which means horiztonal tearing and no <a href="http://www.nebula-electronics.com/information/info.asp?Code=0003">DigiTV</a> at all which is my biggest gripe.

I have searched high and low and no one seems to have a fix for this. As such theres another ¬£20 bounty on this one.

I want my overlay back dammit!
