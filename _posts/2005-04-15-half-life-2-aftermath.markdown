I Received this month's issue of PC Gamer yesterday and read their <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/04/09/half-life-2-aftermath-revealed-in-pc-gamer-uk/">world exclusive</a> on the future of Half-Life last night. Half-Life 2: Aftermath is an expansion to the best game of 2004 but will not be similar in approach to the expansions of the original game. Unlike Opposing Force and Blue Shift which had us playing the role of a marine and a security guard with stories running parallel to that of Gordon Freeman, this time the story picks up right at the end of Half-Life 2.

From the small amount of info revealed in screen shots and the interview it seems the first section of this expansion will be the escape from the crumbling citadel after the massive explosion at the end of HL2.

You will progress through the new levels with your companion Alex who Valve felt they underutilised when she was first introduced. It did seem like you were split up from her at every opportunity so it's pleasing that they want to create more scenarios where you will be fighting along side her, and who knows, maybe DOG will show up again.

The other big departure for this expansion is that it will not be released on the shelves unlike it's predecessors much to their publisher's dismay. By forcing us to use Steam on HL2's release Valve have ensured their future by having a unique content delivery system in place for any future titles they choose to release. So when the new expansion is ready it will pop up on Steam.

From the tone of the article this will probably be the first of several expansions to come through the Steam system allowing us to continue the adventures of Gordon without leaving our seats.
