This was one crazy but great show. Major upsets across the board and pro-wrestling style booking during the show made this one to remember. The constant jabs at the UFC came off as cheap and considerable damage has been done to the potential Liddell vs Silva fight now. From the pre match footage it was clear they were trying to prove that Silva is better than Rampage, Rampage is better than Liddell and therefore Silva would beat Chuck. Scratch that then.

Gomi was once again calling out GSP, Hughes and BJ Penn. Then he stepped into the ring, gassed in the first round and got choked out in the second. An amazing match (fight of the year so far) but Gomi needs to start actually training for fights before he even thinks of going 5 rounds with GSP.

Pride might be dying but this was a highly entertaining show that I recommend checking out for the main events at least.
