I don't normally go into the intricacies of my life on here, partly becuase I find that kind of blogging mundane and boring as hell but what the fuck I feel like shit so here goes.

I think I have come down with the plague, I've had a bad throat for a few days but last night my head started to spin (not helped by cocktails) and my nose went on full flow. I have a pile of work to do and I cannot bring myself to do it in this condition. One of the benfitis of having a real job is you can take a day off and not have to do anything - not so when your a student.

Added to that the weather today was just plain miserable, I don't normally give a crap about the weather, infact I am pretty cold blooded but today was just lousy. Walking back from the shops was not fun.

Highlight of the day so far was TNA Impact which raised my spirits for the brief time it was on. For some reason I really enjoyed this show, definately one of their best. Probablly because Christian is champ and we are headed to a beautiful Ultimate X match next month. Ahhh there we go I feel better already.

The last month has been a bit strenuous on my overall mental stability, its been way too much like a rollercoaster and if I drew a graph it would feature a lot of extreme highs and lows, sadly today is the latter. I like to know where I stand with people, I like to know that the effort I am making is not in vein but most of all I like to know that I am not being strung along with false hopes and promises.

Still got to watch BSG from Friday night so that should be thrilling once again, Ron Moore is a legend. Is it so wrong that TV has become the highlight of my day? Right now that's what I am left with so I'm sure all of you will join me in appreciating another, if fictional legend, <a href="http://tk.files.storage.msn.com/x1pc_jqddVOWRkVs5s5zK-6p_ZcNfh76LwymTxibkccZ7iLS-HGCn5Nem-oyeK-cWN033eAMiM-60S2XiI2tg-zEtG1BKpOz7JCdq8HWr32TGAfW--L8TgYy9-AiaBks0Slv7pi6G3RgC8">Mr Jack Bauer</a> (<a href="http://spaces.msn.com/naomipomi/blog/cns!1BDBB293F3A1B4B8!1739.entry">via</a>).

I have said too much. Adios.
