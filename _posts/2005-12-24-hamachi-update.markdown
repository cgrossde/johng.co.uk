As I have said before Hamachi is awesome and its uses are pleantiful. When I woke up this morning it occured to me I didn't have my music collection with me at home, then a thought crossed my mind. I have iTunes here, I have iTunes at the flat so if I enable sharing.... nah it couldn't be that easy.

Well it works like a <em>dream</em> without lag or delay making full use of the fat upload pipe at the flat.

Oh and now I remember as I am rocking out to it get the new Alkaline Trio album. Best. Stuff. Yet.
