In case you needed reminding this is what November has in store (for me at least):

<strong>9th</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</li>
	<li>Gears of War PC</li>
</ul>
<strong>16th</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Assassin's Creed</li>
	<li>Crysis</li>
</ul>
<strong>23rd</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Guitar Hero III</li>
	<li>Mass Effect</li>
	<li>Kane and Lynch</li>
	<li>Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance</li>
</ul>
<strong>30th</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Unreal Tournament III</li>
	<li>Advance Wars 2</li>
</ul>
I missed out a few there and if you are a Wii owner Mario Galaxy can be added to the list. There is no way anyone is getting through all these this month and I am definitely going to have to start prioritising. Obviously Mass Effect is the most important one there (collectors edition preordered) followed by Crysis and Assassin's Creed dependant on reviews.

My wallet is already feeling the strain.
