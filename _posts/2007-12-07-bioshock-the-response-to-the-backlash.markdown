Gillen has a long and all encompassing <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=88881">defence of Bioshock</a> up at Eurogamer. Definitely worth checking out if you have finished the game. The backlash to the defence against the backlash is <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=708">here</a> and <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article_discussion.php?article_id=88881">here</a> too. Confusing to say the least.

Everyone is struggling to come up with their game of the year for 2007 and it's clearly showing. I can't argue with those that believe it's because there have been so many top notch releases this year but I actually think it's because we have a lot of flawed gems to choose from. Great experiences that are slightly tainted by one thing or another. I know my top 5 will contain the same stuff as many other people but the order will vary wildly.
