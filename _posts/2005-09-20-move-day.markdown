The <strong>long</strong> holiday is finally over and I am moving into my Birmingham flat tomorrow. I have had a few nights stay there but hadn't fully commited all my stuff and as such was in limbo with some of my gear. It will be nice to have everything in one place and it will be great to see everyone at uni again. So fingers crossed for this year, I don't know where I will be by the end of it but hopefully we can all enjoy the ride wherever it takes us.

Incedentally this blog should pick up become a whole lot more entertaining. I hope.

See you on the other side.
