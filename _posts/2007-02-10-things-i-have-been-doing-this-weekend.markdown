*	Fixing python RSS scripts to work with the 'new and improved' <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk">F4WOnline.com</a>. No Bryan I don't like the new design.
*	Going back to XNA but now in Vista (thanks <a href="http://letskilldave.com/archive/2007/02/08/Getting-XNA-Game-Studio-Express-to-run-in-Windows-Vista.aspx">Dave</a>). Here is a <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/capture.PNG">screen shot</a> of a space ship in space in 3D. Yes.
*	Playing the <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax/meatball">latest episode of Sam and Max</a>
*	Watching <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/features/screen-wipe.shtml">Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe</a>. Great great great TV show about TV. Mondays 10pm BBC 4, you will love it.
*	Remembering the music from Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe is also in the movie 28 Days Later which I have just realised has <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/28-Days-Later-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000077KQB/sr=8-1/qid=1171151086/ref=pd_ka_1/203-9414138-4393520?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music">an amazing soundtrack</a> in addition to being an awesome movie. I need this in HD.
*	Cackling manically as my dual core CPU bails under the strain of the <a href="http://www.supremecommander.com/">Supreme Commander</a> demo. This one is a beast folks and the first barrage of many that will force us all to upgrade our PCs in 2007. Even those of us who did so less than a year ago. Damn.
*	Wondering why the hell I pay for PC Gamer if all the articles are just going to <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/sites/pcgamer/">wind up online</a> from now on.
