If you went into a lab, studied the strengths and weaknesses of Tim Sylvia, then built the ultimate machine to defeat him the result would be Randy Couture.

Last night Randy Couture was the perfect weapon against the monstrosity that is Tim Sylvia. It was an incredible sight to watch a 43 year old **decimate this man for 5 rounds straight**. HE OUT BOXED HIM. He took him down. He knew exactly what to do and it was one of the most perfectly put together plans I have ever seen in MMA. I was standing for the entire fight along with the 19,000 in attendance. This is one of those special events that those of us who saw will remember for a <em>very </em>long time.
