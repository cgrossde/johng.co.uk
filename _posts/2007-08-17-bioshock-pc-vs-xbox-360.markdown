This one is driving me crazy. As an owner of an <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Xbox_360_5301790_3">Xbox 360</a> and a PC with a DirectX 10 compatible video card I can't decide which platform to get Bioshock on. The hype has reached such a <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=81479">high</a> <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=169983">level</a> this week that I just can't wait to play it. I have already preordered the 360 version but now I'm thinking I should get the PC version instead. I like achievements and I like relaxing on the sofa but at the same time I want the best graphics possible with room for future expansion. If I can make my mind up I then need to choose between regular edition, steel case edition and bid daddy figurine edition. Ahhhh!

On no now it's on <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=7670&amp;cc=GB">Steam as well</a>!
