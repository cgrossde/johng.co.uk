As I have mentioned in previous posts it's hard for international TNA fans to support the company. Well now is our chance because starting from next month TNA Wrestling are <a href="http://www.mediazone.com/channel/tna/jsp/index.jsp">streaming all their pay per views</a> live over the net. <a href="http://www.mediazone.com">MediaZone</a> is providing the service at only $14.99 which includes the excellent Against All Odds PPV from Sunday. Hopefully our internet holds up here and we am able to watch, if so they will be getting my money and I urge other TNA fans to do the same.

Joe, Daniels and Styles in Ultimate X is quite a nice way to kick things off if you ask me.
