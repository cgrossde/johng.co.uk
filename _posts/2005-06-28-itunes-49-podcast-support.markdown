I have <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/06/28/there-go-my-civil-liberties/#comment-290">tried to add</a> my <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/wp-rss2.php?category_name=Podcast">podcast feed</a> to the iTunes directory but it may take a while to show up, I believe they may even check the content first. Good thing is iTunes doesn't purely rely on the directory to add podcasts, just drag the RSS feed into your list and it will start downloading.

I will look into the new iTunes more when I get the chance but so far it's looking very effective as a podcatching client.

**Update:** Grrr. You can't import OPML files with your subscriptions in, Dave Winer won't be happy.
