The organisation that delivers the statistics for video game sales cannot go around <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5122&amp;Itemid=2">giving opinions and making comments</a> on what those numbers mean. They should be a neutral organisation that delivers facts only.
