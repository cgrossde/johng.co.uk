There has been a lot of <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/sin/sin-episodes-not-canned-232628.php">discussion</a> this week on the future on <a href="http://www.mumbojumbo.com/">Ritual</a> and the Sin Episodes series after they were purchased by <a href="http://www.mumbojumbo.com/">MumboJumbo</a> recently. Aside from the announcement that Sin Episodes is on hold the most important fact gleaned is actual <a href="http://www.ritualistic.com/content.php/interviews/070129_ritual_02.php">sales figures for the game</a>,

> The first episode did well, but not good enough to completely self-fund the second episode. It sold over 150,000 units, which is better than many shooters. It more than paid for itself, but not enough to entirely fund the next one.

If I am not mistaken these are the first numbers released for a Steam based game. It's very important as Valve are keeping their cards close to their chest in regards to online sales and it makes you wonder how many copies Half-Life 2: Episode 1 shifted.
