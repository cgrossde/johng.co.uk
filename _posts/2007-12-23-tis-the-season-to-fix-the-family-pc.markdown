If like me you get home for Christmas and are suddenly bombarded by every family member asking you to fix/cleanup their PCs then <a href="http://www.nabber.org/projects/appupdater/">Appupdater</a> can make your life slightly easier. It basically brings the package management you see from Debian and RPM based Linux distros to Windows, allowing a quick and easy way to update a ton of apps all at once. Lifehacker posted an <a href="http://lifehacker.com/336379/automatically-load-and-update-your-windows-systems">excellent quide</a> which i recommend to anyone who wants to get their system cleanups done as quickly and easily as possible.
