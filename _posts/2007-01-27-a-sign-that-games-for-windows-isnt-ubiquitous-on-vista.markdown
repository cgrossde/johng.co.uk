title: A Sign That 'Games for Windows' Isn't Ubiquitous on Vista

One of the things Microsoft's '<a href="http://www.gamesforwindows.com/">Games for Windows</a>' initiative was supposed to address was the common controller problem on PC. The Xbox 360 controller is now the standard pad and must be supported by all games bearing the 'Games for Windows' logo to get certified. Which makes it strange to hear quotes from Peter Moore <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/microsoft/peter-moore-harps-on-vista-gaming-231119.php">saying</a> "January 30th 2007 will be the most significant day in gaming for the next several years" when it would appear the <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/01/23/540206.aspx">new OS</a> he is hyping doesn't know about the common controller.

This is a small complaint but the fact that a crappy third party PS2 pad (notice the centre dual analogues and tacky rubber grips) has been used as the basis of this icon rather than the 360 pad is another example of how new initatives are not filtering down to the rest of the company. Lazy.
