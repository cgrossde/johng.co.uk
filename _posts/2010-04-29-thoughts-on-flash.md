[Jobs lays it out](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/),

> Our motivation is simple – we want to provide the most advanced and innovative platform to our developers, and we want them to stand directly on the shoulders of this platform and create the best apps the world has ever seen. We want to continually enhance the platform so developers can create even more amazing, powerful, fun and useful applications. Everyone wins – we sell more devices because we have the best apps, developers reach a wider and wider audience and customer base, and users are continually delighted by the best and broadest selection of apps on any platform.

If you want flash don't bother with iPhone OS devices. If you do want flash my question to you would be why? Key sites are already compatible or have apps and games/UI won't work correctly due to the touch interface.

I'm glad Apple are pushing this hard against Adobe. Someone needed to and Apple are in a position where they can. I also hope Adobe come out with a top notch HTML5 package targeted at designers, something that can produce content that works on any platform without the need for bloated plugins.
