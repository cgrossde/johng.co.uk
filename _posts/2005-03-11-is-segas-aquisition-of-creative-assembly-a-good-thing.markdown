I just <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=7293">read</a> to my shock that <a href="http://www.creative-assembly.co.uk/">Creative Assembly</a> have been bought by <a href="http://www.sega.com">SEGA</a>. This could be a good or bad deal for gamers but I feel its going to be bad when it comes to the <a href="http://www.totalwar.com">total war franchise</a> which <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/index.php/2005/03/07/watch-time-commanders-play-rome-total-war/">I am a big fan of</a>. We had already heard earlier in the week that <a href="http://www.gamegossip.com/comment.php?id=12339">Spartan: Total Warrior</a> was coming to consoles from CA, a game that marks a massive departure from their back catalogue. Gone are the huge battles sprawled across massive maps and in is a third person action game with a linear plot. There are a million and one of these types of games on the shelves already and we don't need this great British developer lowering themselves to this. My only hope is that SEGA can put the emphasis back on CA's Total War franchise, but I fear that being primarily a console publisher this won't happen.  I am keeping my fingers crossed for another Total War game or even and expansion to RTW but it could too late and their fate may already sealed.
