I am very impressed with the folks over at <a href="http://www.mtavc.com/">Multi Theft Auto</a>, it has only been a couple of weeks, if that, since San Andreas went on shelves and they aleady have a basic multiplayer game set up. This project is progressing very quickly because of the use of their <a href="http://www.mtablue.info/">'Blue' engine</a> developed before hand that can be plugged into new GTA games with only a slight bit of modification needed.

Who needs Rockstar to develop mulitplayer when we have geniuses like these on the job, heck, they will probablly add a lot more features than Rockstar ever could. Go check out the video <a href="http://www.mtasa.com/">here</a>.
