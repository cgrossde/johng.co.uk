Someone finally posted the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUnbacXma0">awesome video package</a> FujiTV put together for the Fedor Emelianenko vs Mirko Filipovic (Cro-Cop) fight. I have been waiting to see this for a while as just about everyone who saw it last year raved about it.

It's nice to finally see this but it also makes me sad to look back at Pride during its peak like this and compare to what we will have <a href="http://www.fightopinion.com/2006/12/17/latest-man-festival-card-line-up/">this New Year's Eve</a>.
