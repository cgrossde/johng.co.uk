Just ordered Splinter Cell Chaos Theory for <a href="http://www.mx2.co.uk/acatalog/MX2_co_uk_PC_Pre_Orders_S_Z_336.html">¬£17.95 from mx2</a>, nice! I can always find one site that does a new PC release for under ¬£20, unless its an EA game of course ;-). You've got to love these off shore warehouses, with new sites popping up every week the whole of Jersey Island will be covered in large corrugated metal sheds in no time.

Only problem with them is the delivery time, these guys quoted 7 to 10 days for delivery which is pretty slow even considering its free shipping. Good job it doesn't affect me then as I'm going home this weekend anyway and won't be able to play it until next week. Expect a full round up in due course.
