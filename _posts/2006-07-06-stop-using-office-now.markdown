[It's official](http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_to_Support_OpenDocument/1152166759), they did it at the last minute but in some way you will be able to open those OpenDocument format files in Office 2007. This is real good news for open source and it shows what I good job ODF's backers did in getting many governments to adopt it.

What a great time to start using OpenOffice, version 2.0.3 came out last week. Get it [here](http://www.openoffice.org).
