If you are a Twitter user and have an iPhone you really should consider <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=321493542&amp;mt=8">Boxcar</a> from the app store. It's not a twitter client but it does hook into two of the best (tweetie and twitterific).

It simply delivers push notifications whenever you get reply or direct message. This is the way it should be done as regular tweets do not require your immediate attention.

It will completely change the way you use Twitter and make you feel more engaged in the conversation. This is what I had hoped push notifications would deliver in 3.0 and boxcar is the fullfillment of that promise.
