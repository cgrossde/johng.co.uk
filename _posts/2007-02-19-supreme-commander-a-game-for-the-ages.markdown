What's not to love about this game? Like <a href="http://www.tauniverse.com/">Total Annihilation</a> did back in 1997 it completely renews the RTS genre once more and takes it in a totally different direction to anything else on the market or currently in development. As we have seen with other genres, games are splitting up into distinctly different sub-genres and now it's the turn of the RTS. Games such as Company of Heroes and Supreme Commander while both RTSs take radically different approaches to the fundamentals of the genre.

Total Annihilation was a game I played for at least 3 years after release and up until the relatively recent releases of Dawn of War and Company of Heroes I felt the RTS hadn't moved beyond it. This week it has taken a massive bound due to the vision of Chris Taylor and remnants of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavedog">Cavedog</a>. I really do not feel I can do the game justice in a single post here today so as I play through more of the campaign and experiment with the multiplayer I will record my thoughts. I urge you all to spend some time this week digging into 'SupCom' because this kind of thing only comes round once every 10 years.
