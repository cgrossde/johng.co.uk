Zach Arnold <a href="http://www.fightopinion.com/2006/01/23/fight-opinion-radio-file-sharing/">continues the discussion</a> on P2P but in the context of the MMA and Pro Wrestling community,

> For those of you who watch video of fight clips online, how popular is this trend becoming with both you and your friends? Do you use Google Video or do you strictly use BT? I am not asking you to name legal or illegal file sharing sites, but I am curious as to the methods in which you watch fight videos online and if you prefer watching video online as opposed to watching it on DVD.</blockquote>
I wouldn't dream of naming sites or sources, that's something you find out on a need to know basis only, so you can stop reading if you looking for that here.

Being from the UK and living in rented accommodation without satalite or cable television but with a broadband connection this is how I see all MMA and Pro Wrestling events. It's not that I want to dodge paying for additional TV services or buying PPVs, I just do not have the option to.

Using these non-standard distribution methods are the only way I can get to see my favourite sports and/or entertainment. If <a href="http://www.ufc.tv">UFC</a> and <a href="http://www.tnawrestling.com">TNA</a> offered me a way to pay for streamed versions of their shows over the net either live or the day after I would certainly put my money where my mouth is. <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> has proved that the PPV TV on the internet model works and it wouldn't take much effort to expand that to MMA and Wrestling.

Right now the only way I can show my support is by going to live events and by buying pay per views if I'm at someone elses house. My only hope is that these companies see what they are missing with internet distribution and open the flood gates, allowing me and many others to become the legitimate customers we want to be.
