Wonder what I will be doing in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4655555.stm">2012</a>?

Many people, myself included, didn't think we would get it but from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4618507.stm">reports</a> it looks like the Coe factor came into play that finally pushed us ahead.

This is a clear ruling from the IOC that we have better <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2005/07/05/school-children-or-world-leaders-2/">food</a> than France.
