Didn't expect the fight to go like that at all. Forrest got the crap beaten out of him in the first few seconds but he quickly returned the favour and got his opponent to the ground relatively quickly with some good moves. The cut Forrest sustained to his eyebrow is nasty but it would be ridiculous to take such a great fighter out for something like that especially when he has the will and desire to go on. Did anyone else notice the distinct lack of Chris Leben in this episode? After bringing him back in to replace Nate in a lot of controversy last week he didn't even get a mention this time. It seemed deliberate as everyone else on the show had clips played of their one on one interviews apart from him and he was only seen doing some training and chilling in the house. Something must have happened for them to need to edit so much of him out of the show. Or maybe it 's just been Leben overload the last few weeks, it 's just strange because he is the best character on the show and I am sure he would have had a few things to say about the stolen gear in this episode.
