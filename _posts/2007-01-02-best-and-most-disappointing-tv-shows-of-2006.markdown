Well this is an easy one, no top 5 here as it doesn't seem to work for TV. In 2006 the US TV landscape reeled from the previous year's list of disastrous Lost clones and left us with very little.

<strong>Best Show</strong>: Battlestar Galactica
<strong>Runners Up</strong>: The Sopranos, 24, Doctor Who, South Park, The Office, Arrested Development

The difference between Battlestar Galactica and anything else on TV is astounding. While many shows succeed at being entertaining, dramatic, fun, cool, dark, interesting, thrilling and well written, BSG is the only show that does <em>all</em> of them and does them <em>all well</em>.

<strong>Best New Show</strong>: Heroes
<strong>Runners Up</strong>: Torchwood

Heroes takes last year's list of Lost wannabes and pisses all over them, what a difference a year makes for the mysterious serial thriller genre. You may miss this one because 'it's another Lost clone' or 'it's another super hero show' when neither of these statements could be further from the truth. Give it a try.

I was sceptical of Torchwood at first but its had a fair share of cool moments and good tension between the characters. It's nice to see a no holds barred approach to Sci-Fi and it gives it a much more gritty feel than anything else.

<strong>Most Disappointing</strong>: Lost
<strong>Runners Up</strong>: Prison Break

Lost has been suffering badly from being too drawn out, leading to much frustration and a noticeable ratings decline. Rather than resolving existing story arcs new ones are created and then left to rot until they deem it necessary to randomly resurrect them. The minute to minute drama is good but ultimately Lost has delivered <em>nothing</em> in terms of closure.

As for Prison Break, it's just <a href="http://www.johng.co.uk/2006/08/30/prison-break-goes-all-whacky/">wacky</a>!
