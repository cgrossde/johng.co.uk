I've known Ed for a long time (birth) and he and the rest of the band have worked extremely hard and sacrificed a lot to achieve this. As I'm sure those who have listened to the album will agree it's really paying off. It's a strong mixture of metal and punk stylings with catchy riffs and a raging pace. Particular highlights for me include text speak sung in <span style="font-style: italic">chorus</span> (yes, it's true) and Ed laying down the best ROARS I've heard in ages.

Nice one guys, See you on the tour!
