Yesterday after a rather nice Chinese lunch at the Peach Garden in China town, myself and some friends headed into the Bullring to look at cameras. Naturally our first port of call were the fine folks at Jessops, the wonderful photography store that matches service with value for money.

Apon noticing the all new WiFi enabled digital camera had hit the shelves we promptly asked for a demonstration of this major selling feature from the knowlegable staff behind the counter. The gentleman in the middle opened his mouth and this came out,

"Sorry but we cannot show you this feature, we would be breaking copyright laws with Nikon if we did so. By installing their software on our display PC we would be violating copyright."

We were willing to brush this asside and assume this man had just got out of bed but he was far from over,

"If we installed this on our in store computers we could lose our contract with Nikon which may result in potential court action and a fine."

At this point we all just looked at him blankly. I couldn't take this man's stupidity and promtly left the store without saying a word. Some people are just too far gone to bother arguing with I thought. Jay and Ken had more patience than I did however and continued to question the man on the new fangled feature which it turned out he had no clue about. Once they had dragged themselves away from this charismatic individual I learned of his ignorance about wifi, claiming that it was a proprietary technolgy developed by Nikon.

Now I could use this blog to go on and on about how he was so wrong it was ridiculous but the points are blindingly clear. Your not breaching copyright and if you were Nikon don't care as they would love to sell more cameras, which they would if you could show your customers this feature. This man may know a thing or two about what flash I need on my old film based camera but he knows nothing about software or consumer electronics.

The phrase "get your head out of your arse" comes to mind.
