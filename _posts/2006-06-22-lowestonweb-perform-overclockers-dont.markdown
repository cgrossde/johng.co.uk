As mentioned yesterday my hunt for a new processor came up trumps with <a href="http://www.lowestonweb.com/">Lowestonweb.com</a> and it showed up as expected today. They keep you informed throughout the process even sending texts out to tell you to stay in for the delivery. Great service and great prices.

However the old flame <a href="http://www.overclockers.co.uk">Overclockers.co.uk</a>, from which I bought my other components, can in no way match them at all. They have the stock, range and prices which very few stores do but their transparency and overall customer experience is apualing.

I ordered yesterday at the same time as the lowestonweb order yet it still hasn't shown up. Added to that you recieve no confirmation or have any idea what is going on with the order. Their website is still stuck in the 90s while all their competitors have speeded ahead of them.

I hear they are making a ton of money right now and don't feel the need to invest in the site or their aftersales support. Lets just see what happens to their customer base if they keep that up.
