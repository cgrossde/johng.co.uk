Seeing as the BBC do a horrible job promoting <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/features/screen-wipe.shtml">Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe</a>, to the extent that regular viewers like me and BBC Four newsletter subscribers don't know it's on, I thought I'd do them a favour and plug the repeat on here. Watch it.
