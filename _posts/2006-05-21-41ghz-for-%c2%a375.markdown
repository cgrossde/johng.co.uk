A few weeks ago I found out about <a href="http://tomshardware.co.uk/2006/05/10/dual_41_ghz_cores_uk/">this article</a> that claims a Pentium D 805 can be overclocked to 4.1GHz (3.6GHz realistically). This is a really attractive proposition for me as I am about to upgrade (what Oblivion needs, Oblivion gets) so it would be damn cheap if I could get the performance I need this way.

I'll find out if its workable pretty soon as we have the components needed sitting in the flat waiting to be built for someone else's system. If all goes well I will be seriously considering it over the new AM2 chips that are out on Tuesday which I had originally planned on going for. Either way I'll write it up here once I know how far we can push this chip.
